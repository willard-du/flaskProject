3,Sun City Center,Avoid it.,"The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.""There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it."
5,Parma,A Must for Handgunners - Old and New,"This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive. But it manages to impart a lot of knowledge nonetheless and anyone who thinks they know a lot about guns should study the experts. See alsoThe Seven Myths of Gun Control: Reclaiming the Truth About Guns, Crime, and the Second Amendment."
3,Annapolis,The greatest work of the 20th Century,"What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in."
3,Parma,Disappointed,"i love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a blue rays dvd player. which means i can't enjoy it :( i was a bit frustrated. however, other purchases in the past have been great through amazon."
4,Pensacola,Underrated album,"I almost didn't buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others, but I took a chance on it, and I give it 4 stars. ""Put It Where You Want It"" is excellent, both in track one and the jamming version on track 11, and ""Roll With It"" is also excellent. There's no question that it's hard to beat some of Larry's finest songs. My personal favorite is ""Smiles and Smiles to Go"" and it's hard to beat his old album ""Discovery"". But if you're a Larry Carlton fan, I think 4 stars is about right for this one."
4,Elmwood Park,good diaper,"These are good diapers that don't leak, even with overnight soakings. They don't hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers, however."
2,Mansfield,A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.,"as a long-time douglas adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy, at least a dozen time, even wrote down every noun in all 5 for a database,) i read both last chance to see and dghda and loved them. then i read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book i'd ever encountered. i didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. odin and thor bored me senseless. i can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another hhg novel."
3,Holt,LOVE IT!!,"okay, first off i'll tell you that all the books in the series (there are four main series, then a couple ""in-between"" books) are great! however, it gets to be too much. remembering all the names, what clan they come from, who their mate is, who there kits are, who their friends/enemies are, who their brothers and sisters are, it's too much!but, i'm not here to bag on the books, i read the first one because a bunch of my friends were going on and on about them, it's a couple weeks later, and i'm just finishing the last omen, sooo... i don't know if that says anything other than i love warriors!!!!"
2,Burton,Big Problems with Amazon's Quality Control,"The DVD did not match the title of the cover. Literally the wrong movie was in the ""Anne of Green Gables - The Continuing Story"" sleeve. Pretty much of a let down. Come on Amazon get on your suppliers.Joe"
4,Parma,AN ARTIST'S LIFE,IRVING STONE HAS HIS READERS RELIVE VINCENT VAN GOGH'S LIFE.AFTER READING THE BOOK YOU CAN EASILY APPRECIATE THE TUMULTOUS LIFE THIS ARTIST HAD.THE AURTHOR HAS USED CERTAIN FICTIONAL MOMENTS AS HE AGREES TO IN THE END.THESE ONLY MAKE THE BOOK MORE READWORTHY.THE EMPHASIS IN THIS BOOK IS ON THE LIFE OF VINCENT VAN GOGH IN RELATION TO THE ART HE PRODUCED.ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVOURITES.
3,Pensacola,"Good Movie, but Best Picture of the Year?","This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year..."
3,Bridgewater,Don't buy,"Stay away from baseball game this year. Without MVP baseball having the mlb license, the games just aren't worth the time and money. MLB the show, has terrible game play and overall isn't fun to play. I bought MLB the show one night and sold it the next. MVP basebal sucks with the college players so don't buy that either."
2,Burton,Clichéd,"This is the first time I have ever written a review of a record on here and unfortunatly I've been moved to do so through abject boredom.This is the most clichéd, repetitive, cringingly bad record I have heard in a long time. I'm just glad that not everyone that listens to it will understand Spanish enough to shudder at each cheesy lyrics and forced stereotypes it contains. Really give it a wide berth."
2,Kenmore,Started interesting,"It certainly doesn't lack a twist, but to say it's a clever one would be false. It really is entirely social commentary just after the middle of the movie, but not really social commentary that has any basis in reality or even political affiliation...it's a dreamer sentiment that implies adversity is wrong and elitist paths are the only way...that's not really what I thought I was getting into when I started a movie called ""Tall Man"" involving a creepy figure and child abductions. It's not to say I was hoping it wouldn't be intelligent, I'm saying it isn't intelligent. I gave two stars for the fact that it was an unpredictable twist, though a silly one."
4,Pensacola,extra hanging space where you need it,"This product is great for the laundry room, and I put one up in the master bath, it's great for laying out your close for the next day, or for hanging your close as you finish ironing them."
5,Orland Park,Excellent!,"Eighties movies do NOT get any better than Bill and Ted! This movie rocks in all concieveable ways, and in ways few have dared ever repeat. This is excellent, but the lack of extras is non-non-heinous."
2,Sun City Center,What a waste of money!,It is a pity that a respected author should stoop to putting his name in big letters on the front cover of a book that was very obvoiusly written (badly) by others. I was left with a real sense of having wasted my money.
2,Annapolis,Not worth the money,"I didn't even give this movie 1 star but had to in order to post this. This was the most money I've spent on a DVD through Amazon.com and I was extremely disappointed. I suffered through the whole movie, hoping it would get better or even make sense before the ending. It was a waste of my money and my time. I bought it because someone recommended it. Not sure why. I buy Christian based movies more than secular and for the most part, like them all....but not this one. Horrible acting, horrible production, hard to follow. Very dissatisfied."
4,Burton,Valley of Vision,This book is so very good. Please read and enjoy. If you need a lift and want someone to understand please get this book.
2,Pensacola,pop history,"Unfortunately, William Manchester did not do his homework before writing this work. To his credit, he does at least admit to not doing the research. This book might provide an interesting story, but readers need to be aware that it cannot masquerade as a serious history text."
3,Wausau,Is this supposed to be scary?,"Always be wary of films which claim to be better than some box-office hit or other.This cash-in on Jurassic Park bears no resemblance in the slightest to Harry Adam Knight's brilliant novel Carnosaur. So why bother getting copyright in the first place?The ideas behind this film are vaguely interesting and there is some good scenery, but what lets it all down are some of the most laughable, unconvincing dinosaurs I've ever had the misfortune to waste my time watching. The creatures in the silent 1925 Lost World are far better than these pathetic creations. So much for progress.Do yourself a huge favour and watch Jurassic Park instead. Or failing that, Barney. He's a far more convincing dinosaur than the rubber abominations in the complete turkey that is Carnosaur. If the sequels are as bad as this I don't think I'll bother with them."
4,Mansfield,"Interesting, if somewhat uneven","Never dull, if sometimes uneven in quality. The truth, and memory are ever subjective. Great photos. Despite the hoopla surrounding its release, it's worth a read."
2,Parma,Not so great - waste of money,I bought these headphones for my husband who works out and runs every day. They were uncomfortable and the sound quality was not very good. Didn't take long for the sound to go out in one of the earphones.
5,Burton,Decent earbuds,"These have pretty good sound, but do not block out much other sound. The twist to fit system is a little fiddly. I am still not sure that I am doing it right, but it works pretty well."
3,Pensacola,They do the job,Not much to be said about this product. Just watch for a low price and then stock up!
4,Brookfield,Keeping the gray matter awake,Having gone through the Private and Commercial cylabus I realised how quickly one forgets the all-important calculations... This guide keeps you current and your thoughts aligned without having to remember all the complicated match exactly
3,Elmwood Park,Super easy to use,"The scanguage has been a very satisfying purchase, super easy to install (just stick it in place with velcro and plug it in) and easy to use, with all kinds of information about the functions of the engine. I'm using it to optimize my driving for fuel economy, and it shows me instantaneous fuel use as well as mileage by the trip, by the day, or by the tank. You can also use it for miles-to-empty and for engine diagnostics.Great product."
3,Fort Lauderdale,FABULOUS!!!,"this is an updated, modern, slick and stylish new ""v"". i loved the campiness of the original mini-series and was dubious that the new version could capture me, but i was wrong! it is terrific, and the beautiful, but deadly anna is mesmerizing! good acting, great special effects and a story just interesting enough to carry the thing along, makes me impatient for each new episode. you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate this series! (yes, it is funny, as well as exciting.)"
2,Sayreville,They Are A Disgrace To All Of Hip Hop,"This album is so awful that I sold it the day after I bought it. I think the Beastie Boys should go home to their mole hole... Beastie Boys get P.S. For some real Rap, go and purchase Juveniles' 400 Degrees."
1,Lancaster,Poor,"I am an avid fan of classic radio, but this collection is the worst I have encountered of this genre."
2,Elmwood Park,PYREX EXPLODES!`,"DON'T BUY PYREX!!!! pyrex has a tendancy to EXPLODE for NO REASON! I worked for World Kitchen (owns Pyrex) and got tons of cases where pyrex exploded for no good reason. preheated ovens with no significante temp change... normal use and care and it EXPLODES!!!DON""T USE!!!"
2,Annapolis,Not Very Helpful,"This book is very limited. You have to look at each page to ID the flower. Some pictures are not very clear, and some do not show the leaves. If the plant you look at is not excatly like the book's pix you can't be 100% sure of the plant's ID."
4,Brookfield,A very realistic book about a different Gettysburg...,"Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen get together to write a very realistic Civil War novel about what would have happened if Robert E. Lee decided to carry out a sweeping, massive movement to out-flank the Union Army. Unlike most books about the Civil War, this book tosses out luck and almost magical changes in the thoughts of the main characters, basing the action and combat on the reality of the men and the leaders within both armies.The battle scenes are painfully real, causing me to feel horror at some of details. Both authors refuse to hide anything, showing the heroism and the gore that was the Civil War battlefield.A must for a What-If library or a Civil War library!"
4,Wausau,Transcends its time and its particulars,"here's what you do: 1. buy this book. 2. set it aside until a long, rainy afternoon presents itself. 3. enjoy a wonderfully written love story."
2,Holt,Sad to be a Robbie Fan,"I cannot beleive Robbie would be so concern about hisimage, and about breaking into the states, that he wouldan album like this, does he want to be someone he isn't?The songs are poorly written, but they are sang okay.The selection of songs dont flow, and the album justwont work in any country. EMI are in huge trouble nowthey will be looking for more Beatles albums and beggingGarth Brooks to come out of retirment, so make up for themoney they have lost on this guy."
4,Eastchester,Funny,Chevy Chase can get a laugh with just the look on his face. He does so several times throughout this classic movie. One of the things that makes this film so popular is that a lot of us relate to it for two reasons; it a family setting and cross country travel is involved.There's the usual comedic situations Chevy encounters such as getting lost in St. Louis and arriving at Wally World after it's been closed for cleaning. But there's also more. A nice mix exists whereby the comic rhythm is given an ebb and flow as small amounts of romance are inserted periodically.The downside is the treatment of the grandmother. That isn't a funny bit. It distracts from an otherwise very funny movie.
2,Burton,Yuck!,"I don't know how anybody can say this tastes even at all close to starbucks white mocha sauce. It has a really bad artificial after taste and is not rich and buttery like starbucks white mocha. My husband and I both drank this equally and he agreed that it was not worth a second purchase. If you really want a good white mocha, go with the ghiradelli sweet ground white chocolate powder. Now that is fabulous and tastes exactly like a starbucks white mocha. This torani white chocolate sauce is just plain bad, we had to almost plug our noses to get it down."
3,Pensacola,Simply Put - Satisfied!!!,"A Lesson Before Dying was delivered in a timely manner.Condition - like new. Only 3 slightly foldedpage holders. Binding was fine. No visiable damage, nopages missing, no personal notes in the book at all.Was simply very satisifed with this purchase.Thank you Amazon and thank you Book Squared.Would definitely recommend based on this first book."
5,Wausau,A screwball comedy with rather too many coincidences,"Sir Richard is the titular hero, a wealthy, handsome man who is being pestered to marry and keep his noble bloodline going. His short-sighted family is pushing him at a cold-blooded woman whose family is floundering in debt. Feeling trapped, he encounters a lively young lady who, also feeling pressured to wed (her cousin, who looks like a fish) has taken matters into her own hands, dressed as a boy, and intends to run off to a childhood playmate. Sir Richard decides to accompany her on her expedition, and they have a series of adventures that somewhat strains credulity. Although it is easy to see what each sees in the other, there is not actually any romantic zing; rather, there is a great deal of charm and humor. I don't consider this one of the best of Heyer's books, but it is a very good read."
3,Bridgewater,Wasn't what I paid for.,"Instead of the video cassette advertised, I received a tape of a family's home movies in the sleeve."
1,Marysville,Another Kindle Disaster,"For God's sake, Amazon, don't you ever look at Kindle products before putting them for sale? The words in this Kindle edition are run together. From now on, I will rate all Kindle disasters as one star."
3,Lancaster,We need a book about TYPICAL triplet pregnancies!,I read this book in it's entirety and it scared me to death. THis woman obviously had many health issues besides being pregnant with triplets. I don't think this paints a picture of a typical triplets pregnancy.
4,Orland Park,Umbra tab top panels,"These window panels look very nice, and are well-made. Only problem I have is that the 86"" panels are barely 85"" long, including the tab tops. Once hung on the rod, which spreads the tab out some, they're closer to 84"" long. I was really hoping they'd be the full 86"", but they will still work, just glad I didn't install the rods without measuring first."
3,Parma,"I tried to like this, but...","i love piano ensembles, and jason is very talented, but i sure don't enjoy anything on this recording. i kept it in the cd player for five days straight, and for me anyway, there is too much pointless noodling around. i have no problem with the ""new take on the blues"", but what take? some sparse twanging, some nervous bass lines that i simply am not moved by and can't connect with at all, and some pounding. perhaps this is just not my kind of music. but in fairness to myself, i can handle adventure, dissonance, noise, looseness; this just doesn't amount to much. i sure love the playing on black stars and the live badwagon recording (except i still get too distracted by the nervous bass that seems like somebody playing in a diferent band in the next room), but this cd leaves me flat. i'll watch jason because he is certainly ""the real deal"", no doubt about that, but i'd pass on this one."
2,Kenmore,DISAPPOINTED,THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD QUALITY KNIFE AS MOST ARE BY THIS MFG..BUT IT PROVED TO BE A CHEAP VERSION.
3,Parma,Dated but Clive doesn't disappoint,"i kind of laugh at all the smoking that goes on in this book, but it was good. i love clive and have read most all of dirk's adventures. not sure how i missed this one, but glad i found it. short and sweet."
3,Eastchester,An oldie but goodie,"Current television shows are more sophisticated and complex plots are standard. However, the first generation of westerns deserve a look. While Have Gun - Will Travel is a show I grew up with and remembering my youth is a part of the attraction, it is one of the first of its kind and laid down the traditions of a real ""good guys win out over the bad guys"" shows. Single tread plots are standard, but the acting is good and you will see many of the pioneers of television in their early roles."
2,Sayreville,smoothies not so smooth,"although this blender is beautiful, mine wasn't able to perform even the most basic of blender tasks adequately. despite several minutes of full-speed blending, it left a banana smoothy full of banana chunks big as marbles. even my old $25 blender could handle a soft banana! as decor, it's fine, but as a blender, it doesn't cut the mustard (or the banana)."
2,Bridgewater,That's all ????,"As a user of v.X, I was looking forward to this. Well, as muchas anyone looks forward to new MS software. Maybe a root canal wouldbe more fun.I just don't see it. They want me to cough up $350 for a some really minorfeature additions? Even on the MS webpage, they have a hard time findingmore than 1-2 bullet 'enhancements' for each component. And I'd haveto believe that NoteTaker or NoteBook is a better application than whateverMS's v1 of their Notebook facility is. And don't forget the all important Messengerintegration :(Very disappointed."
2,Bridgewater,Unengaging,"I tried to give this a chance, because it's set in Sweden, but after the 50-page test, I saw that it was just another boring police novel. (DNF)"
5,Parma,SO CUTE! Love it!,"i received this book in a timely fashion. it also is in excellent condition. my 1 1/2 year old son loves all the interactive activities in it. there are pockets, flips, flaps, velcro, sliders, and a mirror. my son loves digging out the surprises that are in the pockets. would definitely by from again!"
3,Bridgewater,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP!!!,"No idea if it's any good b/c though it says it works with Windows XP, as several others have also said, it does not, it crashes the system repeatedly."
2,Marysville,not what I expected,"It's not the color I expected, but it's ok I will wear it to see how much I like it"
2,Pensacola,Stiff vocals and music,"Grace Jones albums are like a box of chocolate. You never know what you are going to get. Grace Jones started out as a disco queen and then moved into new wave and finally came back to pop.This is Grace Jones' first album. It is disco versions of show tunes and original songs. Her voice is really stiff. It does not go well with the material. She would use her unique sound much better in her new wave material, such as Warm Leatherette. The music is also very stiff. It has the basic disco beat, but there is no interest to the music. It is all very boring.On her next disco attempt, Fame, she would open up a little more and the results are more satisfying."
4,Elmwood Park,Excellent Information!,"I got this book for my sister -- at half the price stores are charging. She's amazed at the material contained (which doctors don't seem to know anything about). I have a copy of my own and am ""into it"" week after week. I've tried many of the suggestions given and they do work!"
4,Pensacola,Slender volume but most interesting read,"At a young age, the author Clara Pinto-Correia heard about the long extinct dodo and became fascinated by the bird's fate. The end result is a well-researched and well-written text that takes the reader from the shores of Europe to a small chain of islands where the dodo and it's genetic cousins made their homes.Sadly, the dodo and it's genetic cousins were doomed to extinction with the arrival of Europeans (starting with the Portuguese). The plump, flightless animals were slow breeders with a single offspring per mating season and no natural enemies. Add ravenous creatures (Homo sapiens included) into their safe mircosphere and diaster was assured.Pinto-Correia traces the few captive dodos in Euorpe and the fates of their remains. Now, the only things the modern world has of the dodo are a scattering of bones, some paintings and sketches and the cultural understanding that to be a dodo is to be doomed.A must read for the natural history reader or devotee."
5,Fridley,Does the job,Would have given it 5 stars except that the Velcro should have gone a bit tighter... A my mat is not a fat one.
3,Sun City Center,"Very, very good","I first heard, and bought, this album back in the 1970's. I really liked it then and I am glad to be able to have it again. It is a cheery upbeat album with a couple of lead singers that harmonize well."
4,Parma,Finally the story moves ahead!,"Just before this book came out, I decided to re-read the first 8. Books 1-4 were excellent, exciting, and impossible to put down, and I noticed a lot that I didn't see the first time. Books 5-8 slow down significantly, and I found my self frustrated by reading an entire book without hearing about one or two of the major characters. Finally book 9 moves things along!! Once again the book is surprising, eventful, and leaves on an up note. I disagree with the poor reviews I read prior to reading this book."
2,Eastchester,"Flat characters, bad science, weak, unbelievable plot","Sphere is the same as all of Crichton's books. A group of people go into a novel environment (lost jungle city/dinosaur inhabited island/spaceship under water) get chased by monsters, everything blows up, solving the problem.The science in Sphere is highly suspect, the characters are flat, the plot is unbelievable. After years of students telling me how great the book was and not being able to read it, I finally forced myself to get beyond the first couple of chapters. The story didn't get any better. I still didn't care about the characters. The plot was almost page-by-page predictable.Forget this book."
2,Fridley,More than an erotic novel. Hold on to your copy,"This book is basically soft pornography in a western setting. Hold onto your copy because it's hard to find and expensive, I suppose due to the fact that erotic lesbian novels are not the kind of thing republicans like to brag about writing and it may have been held back from press, hence not a lot of copies are out there. Personally I find that rediculous, and it hasn't stopped a few from getting out anyhow. There's some sexual violence and lesbianism running throughout the story, but nothing terribly shocking. I suppose if you like soft porn or lesbian stories, with a touch of violence, and the old west, you might enjoy this tale. It's only worth buying for the political hypocrisy value, not as a crafted piece of literature imho."
4,Pensacola,No other book compares,"I am still amazed that this book is published and out on shelves and covers what it does. It goes into components, flash remoting, shared libraries, drawing API, and many other features that most MX books are lacking. Flash Remoting alone is a reason to buy this book. I am also pleased to see that New Riders has put out a book that I can consider a desktop reference. It has a quick reference in the back covering Flash MX objects, shortcuts, and more. I would suggest taking a look at the Table of Contents and you will see all the neat things this book covers."
2,Pensacola,Doesn't stand up to the competition,"I suppose I can't expect the world from a $6 thermometer but it doesn't seem to be able to stand up with even the slightest nudge on the RACK (not the therm). Quite the problem unless you have the feather touch taking pans in and out of the oven. Not to have all my hopes dashed, it does tell pretty accurate temp when it is upright. The hanging tab works great if you have the room to hang it, not an option for me since I often use the bottom rack. If polder beefed up the bottom stand or added some counter weight, this would be a good little thermometer. Until then, keep your long handled tongs handy to pick it up off of the element."
2,Brookfield,A Look at a Seperate Peace,"It shoudn't take so may words to describe this book. Of cousre if you think their should be a lot of words in this review, then you will probably enjoy this book. The use of extreme desricption ruined what could have been a good book. To many words ruined this review don't you think?"
5,Burton,Canon ink,Every time I order these ink cartridges I never have a problem with the performance. My prints are always crisp and sharp looking.
1,Bridgewater,Swimsuit,Size was too small. I ordered the size I have bought in similar suits yet this one was very small. I had to return it.
3,Fridley,BRILLIANT,Forget all the bad reviews. This is the album where Mayhem finally got it together. This is the greatest black metal album ever recorded all the way.
3,Bridgewater,WTF Happened?,"This is not about Riverdance.This is about what this disc did to murder it.I popped it in, expecting to see my favorite dance scenes (while conveiniently skipping the singing), when all of a sudden I'm at the finale. All I could say was ""WTF?!"", ""WTH?!"", or words to that effect.This ""SuperBit"" edition cuts out half -- HALF -- of the scenes this performance had to offer, including (but certainly not limited to) Riverdance and Trading Taps.Not only that, but (unless the ""high def"" only works for high-end TVs) the video quality is equal to my old VHS copy.I sincerely hope this problem only occurs on my copy, but I suggest to get a refund webpage ready, because the atrocious product I received royally screws this great perform up the ---!"
4,New Windsor,What a Story Maccarrone Tells!,"I just finished Abigail's Lake - and WOW! It's the best book I have read in a very long time. By the time I got to the third chapter, he had grabbed me so totally that I couldn't put the book down until I finished it!Maccarrone is an excellent writer. I can clearly see his book being translated to the big screen, and if I were a movie producer, I'd grab the rights. The suspense and drama built into his style are naturals. I hope he comes out with another page-turner real soon!"
5,Eastchester,"Good, but one flaw...","The iron is very good for the price I paid. Steam feature is perfect and it is comfortable in my hand. The only problem is the cord did not retract after the first use, so I am forced to wrap it around the unit to store. Not a big deal, but having a cord retractor would have been nice and it was part of the reason I chose this iron."
2,Pensacola,Not fun at all.,"After reading the review of A. Scott from London, I felt that I just had to throw in my 2 cents worth. I absolutely agree with Mr Scott. More irritating for me than a history lesson being recited, was the one dimensional charaters. I just didn't find any character believable, and really couldn't give a crap whether they lived or died. I knew very little of Atlantis before reading this, but apart from the one or two facts I learned, I have to say, I have wasted a week's reading time."
1,Holt,Terrible book.,"This is not a good book. This was assigned to me for a business school class. I'm one of those people that really get into the subject matter and into learning. But, if you are going to buy this for self-improvement, try something else.Here is why:1. The writing is boring. It's extremely hard to get through each chapter.2. The sections that make up each chapter don't seem to relate to each other. They don't seem to make sense. At least to me."
4,Sayreville,All the wino's agree - it's GREAT!,It charges fast and lasts a long time. Removes all of the cork which is a MUST. AND it looks great on the counter!
1,Lancaster,Avoid use with smart media cards,Use of this product has resulted in the unusability of my two smart media cards in the past 24 hours. The company's FAQ page in their tech support page states that this is due to old firm ware. I cannot find a solution to this problem online.
4,Fort Lauderdale,Classic Western,"This is Clint Eastwood at his finest as opposed to talking to a chair at the Republican National Convention. The movie is exciting, fun, and funny in places with a great sound track. It's a must see for Western fans. It's almost as good as Unforgiven."
1,Pensacola,i hate the time-out,"i liked this heating pad...until the blinking light came on. i sometimes use a heating pad all evening. why should i have to turn it back on every 15 minutes? very annoying. mine heats well, but won't stay on. A mistake i won't make again."
4,Sun City Center,carefully crafted and intriguing,"This book takes a little while to get going, because there is a lot of description and not as much action in the beginning, but it is worth it because Ms. Hoffman creates her setting so painstakingly and convincingly. The book deals with the cruelties and class rifts that occur in a private school and the working-class town where the school is located. The book has riveting images and strong, believable characters. It will probably give some parents second thoughts about sending their children to private school, especially since some of the hazing rituals probably had some grounding in reality."
1,New Windsor,In the dark!!!,"I heard this album about a week ago,my friend lent it to me and I listened to it it was a very weak production of what we call nu-rap.The song with Busta was off the hook and I liked one other song that was about it.I have listened to rap all my life,I'm 27 now and take it from me do not buy this,it sounds like a rush job.They tried to throw together some beats and put it out.They can rap no doubt but it sounds thrown together.HATED IT!!!"
2,Mansfield,Horrible,"DVD is absolutely horrible. DVD scratched, freezes does not play and was copied. Not in the original box. I was duped."
3,Burton,Fifa,Game was in perfect condition! Easily able to play hours on hours of this game. The best fifa I have played. Go Liverpool!
3,Annapolis,God will provide in time of great need!,"Mr. Walker has been thru many trials in life, and his book is another great testimony of how God is faithful and will provide to those who seek Him first. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are going thru a major life changes such as a job loss or divorce. I have also read ""Starting over God's way."" by Mr. Walker. No matter how much you have stumbled in the past or even turned your back on God, He is still right behind you ready to receive you."
3,Kenmore,Data does not transfer at all,"I ordered 6 keychains, all working but none of them connected to computer after applying all setting given on different forums like of ""USB Updates"" etc. I tried on 4 different computers/Laptops. It shows the image beautifully comes by default, but its of no use if you can not transfer your own data."
2,Brookfield,You Get What You Pay For!!!,"The phone charger is pretty standard & works fine. However the phone case is very poorly crafted, and looks like it was made very hastily. The phone lid won't even close properly. I was too embarassed to even send it back. The charger alone was probably worth the ten bucks so that's why I kept both items. I guess I was lured to this item by the price, but as the saying goes you get what you pay for."
2,Holt,Over half of the disks are scratched . . .,"Mash is fine, but this package is abysmal!Who was the idiot jerk who chose to pack these DVDs as they are here? I hope for he to be unemployed now . . . I know that this is not much charitable, but the level of frustration this person has inflinged to us, MASH fans, . . .As uncountable others said before, my set is unusable; over half of the disks are scrathched."
3,Eastchester,Delightful book,"i love this book. i just finished reading it, tears streaming down my face. as with most women, the more i cry in a book the more i love it and i had tears at least 3 times. the powerful writing, unique in several ways, pulled me in and i felt the tension, the mystery (this is not a conventional mystery, so i am talking about the mystery of life and love, the inevitability, though i was not assured of inevitability as i read along)...oh, there are so many things i love about this book. i just know the author had a wonderful time writing it. i loved every single quirky character. i loved the scenery, and of course the bears, alive and sculpted, that wove their ways into my heart."
4,Holt,"more,more,more","I've read every book W. Sarabande has written. Please ,lets have a sequal to Wolves of Dawn, Please, Please, Thank you . My husband has been down in the den six hours so far, still reading it. hopefully he will surface soon ....."
2,Bridgewater,Battery Please,"I think this is nice, but I have yet to find the alkaline battery this requires. I have been to 2 stores and they didn't have the particular kind needed. So if you want to use it right away, don't order it. But if you don't mind driving around to find the battery it needs, then it is probably fine. I should have just driven to a store to get a calculator with a battery."
2,Kenmore,This a boring book,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is about a 13-year old boy who saves a cow and gets a piglet in return. The best part of the book is when Rob goes to Rutland Fair and struggles to see a pervert. This part of the book gives the story line good humor and laughs. I thought it needed more action, or comedy to make it better. This book might be good for Elementary Schools but not for Middle School students who are more mature than this.I do not recommend this to mature kids who enjoy humor and action."
2,Sayreville,Piece of Junk...,"My son ordered one of these carts for his Mom and the cart broke in 2 days. Sent back. Ordered another cart as a replacement and it did not last any longer. Sent it back also. These shabby carts are not assembled well and critical parts are either missing or fall or break. Just plain Junk.On a good note, thank you Amazon for your great RETURN POLICY !"
1,Parma,Disappointed walker,"The belt clip did not hold the recorder in place. I had to hold the recorder instead of weights as I walked. Sound was good, but the tape recorder stopped working after less than 30 days.Instructions on preset channels difficult to understand. My previous Panasonic recorder lasted eight years. What a disappointment this one is!"
4,Brookfield,Good kit,"Just moved to the US from the UK, and needed a multiregion player. I've had a few players before, but this has to have the easiest region free code entry I've come accross - literally took 10 seconds.Apart from that, it's a good quality upconverting player, and the enclosed HDMI lead makes it a bargain. I've not found a disk yet that upsets it, and I've got a fair few that upset quite a few other players.Downsides are the lack of *16 fast forwarding - 2,4, 64 are the only choices, which is a shame as 4 is too slow, and 64 too fast when you want to search for a scene. I can forgive it this however, due to its other qualities."
4,Mansfield,a must for Zappa fans,"A great group of musicians. Dedicated to Zappa's compositions. Ernie Watts solo on How Would You Like To Have A Head Like This, inspired me to play the sax. Quality musicianship throughout, this will not disappoint."
5,Holt,Listen once...put it down...then listen again,"Okay...like a lot of posters here I was at first disappointed with the results of this CD. Being a huge AJ fan, I bought the CD the day it came out and couldn't wait to hear what else he had to offer - especially since the title cut was literally playing in my head day and night. I figured that maybe he asked Alison Krauss to produce the one song and then the rest of the CD would be usual AJ fare.I listened to it one time through and thought...what the @#&%?!I put it down a few days and put it back on my CD player. I feel much better about it now than I did a few days ago. It is a departure of sorts for Alan...not what one would expect. However, I believe this album will bring him some critical acclaim from those who normally don't listen to his usually ""Gone Country-esque"" style. It's pure...it's simple and sometimes understated. But isn't that AJ?"
4,Holt,The Who at their Best.,"Unavailable in Oz, so had to import one of the Greatest Who albums ever.Just an amazing example of Rock and an added bonus with a variation to ""Who Are You?"" I'd never heard before and Keith Moon still playing. What a legend!"
3,Burton,Disappointed,"I expected another wonderful book featuring Kay Scarpetta. Instead I found new characters in a plot that held little suspense, action or inherent interest. Is Patricia tired of Kay? Does she want to move away from her as Doyle did with Holmes? I found the book to be very disappointing and would not recommend it"
4,Pensacola,great book,this is a great book. really goes into detail about the mob and the teamsters.and i can't wait for the movie the irishman.
4,Wausau,Are you kidding - this has got to be in your James collection,"This album is so core, James. If you have Laid, or one of the ""Best of"" albums ... you have finally grown up.You have to own this.The album cover, which smacks of sex and cheapness and rudeness and all of that that only James can weave into such smooth, moving tunesthat you will just put this on autoplay one day and escape from this world into one that is only James' world.Wow."
3,Pensacola,Atmospheric and Gritty Sci-Fi Shoot'em Up -Bad DVDTransfer!!,"I basically mirror the comments of previous reviewers who give this film high marks for storyline and action.My main complaint is the outrageous quality of the transfer over to DVD. I have yet to come across a DVD that has such terrible image quality. It is like looking at an old VHS tape. Image outlines shimmer and fluctuate. Lighting and shadow effects darken and lighten. Sound quality is OK in my opinion. Nonetheless, the image quality is an annoying distraction which degrades the overall enjoyment of this finely done Sci Fi thriller.If you must get this DVD, write to Warner Studios and tell them how lousy a job they did on this DVD transfer. This film deserved much better attention to image quality. I am sure many of you would have screamed bloody murder if ""Alien"" had been so poorly done.Warner needs to come out with an ""Outland SE"" to rectify this problem. ..."
3,Fridley,"Works even for ""historic"" stains!","I recently acquired a 12 qt. Calphalon hard anodized stock pot and used it two or three times before getting Calphalon Dormond cleanser. The pot developed black-on-black watermark type stains on the inside bottom and the inside lid.I tried Barkeeper's Friend (because I had it on hand) to remove the stains, but to no avail.When the Dormond arrived I scoured both watermarked areas 6 to 8 times and was finally able to eliminate them, totally. I trust that timely application after each future use of my stockpot will not require nearly such quantity of effort."
3,Orland Park,Childish,"This the first and only Star Wars movie that I've seen (I saw it in theaters) and the reason I saw it was because of the hype around ""Star Wars"". Everywhere you turn they talked about ""Star Wars"". So I went to see it and I was SHOCKED.This movie is so childish, I was shaking my head the whole time. It's full of weird looking characters that act & talk like retarded creatures, it's just so childish!!! I couldn't believe my eyes, I expected something that ""could"" appeal to an adult. I mean even Harry Potter looked good, it was not an insult to intelligence. I will never understand why adults camp outside theaters weeks before the release of Star Wars movies. This movie is for people under age 12, SERIOUSLY. I felt insulted as an adult viewer. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that ""perhaps"" kids would enjoy it."
3,Sun City Center,Hanging folders,Thanks for the very nice hanging folders. They work perfect in my file drawer. Nicely priced and well made. Thanks again.
3,Burton,I long for the good old days,"wow, i got this product and i was shocked at how strong it is. i used royal secret many years ago, and it was a wonderfully subdued scent reminding me somewhat of baby powder. i loved it! it is not the same! i barely put any on now and i will not buy this again."
5,Orland Park,Baseball Display,"As usual, my purchase from Amazon.com was delivered in a very timely manner. The baseball display and card holder is just as advertised and does a great job of protection and display. Overall a great value for your dollars spent."
4,Kenmore,"Thin, but accurate and entertaining","I am uncomfortable giving any book a number rating, but this form requires it. Is Bongwater a Great Book? No, but it is a good read and is certainly better than any of the novels I have written (zero). I lived in Portland in the 80's and am very familiar with the scene described in the book. I felt like I knew a lot of the characters and the characterizations were not as gonzo as you might want to believe. I actually purchased this book because I knew the author when he was living in Portland in '86 and was afraid the Lisa character might be me. Having read it, I am pretty sure it's not, but it's possible Michael remembers me less fondly than I remember him."
1,Orland Park,Average sound system,Unit does not have the individual frequency range control that I need. Also the programing is quite complex. Seems to me the sound is very hollow. Very pricey for what it is. All functions do operate ae described in the owners manual. Guess I needed to do more shopping.May be alright for an entry level Home theater system.
2,Eastchester,Disappointed.,"i'm a male, and i find butch women extremely attractive. when i saw this book, i expected it to be the love woes of a masculine woman who couldn't find her place in the world. instead, i cannot get past the first chapter, which is nothing but ""men are evil."""
5,Mansfield,this book has been a lifesaver for our whole family!!,"we are all sleeping through the night because of this very helpful and very practical book. our baby was sleeping all night after two nights of ""stretching"" his schedule. i am a nursing mom and i had reservations at first. however, i am a believer and now i have recommended this book to many friends who love it,too. the method works without being rigid or cruel. the idea of the ""focal feeding"" makes so much sense!! i did not feel guilty when trying this method and i appreciate the authors sharing the information with young momand dads. i also like the option of having dad or another caregiver involved with the process. overall, i couldn't have survived without it. thank you !"
4,Holt,AWESOME CD,"I heard this CD, when it first came out. Lost the CD, ordered a new CD to replace it, and was blown away. The extra songs on it make it worth the $$$."
4,New Windsor,I bought it,Our wall turn on switch went bad a couple of times in our bathroom. This thing really makes life easier than going to the bathroom by candlelight (smile).
2,Fridley,"Great watch, until the latch on the band broke","I have had this watch in a zip loc bag for the last year! I have taken the watch to several watch stores...and they cannot fix it as the (tricky) latch on the watch has to be soldered back on to the band! This watch lasted on my arm for less than a month. This is a sever disappointment as the watch is not inexpensive!On the plus side, the watch is very handsome."
2,Brookfield,capitol collectors series,Nothing much to justify this Sinatra release. The addition of one track is insufficient to have re-released this compilation.
5,Annapolis,light bulbs don't last,I have these lights on my van for about 4 years and both bulbs were replaced already. The replacement bulbs are expensive and in my opinion do not last very long considering I seldom use the lights. The installation was fairly easy and the lights are of high quality. It does provide an additional margin of safety in dark rainy nights.
4,Marysville,"Very Thorough, well-sourced, informative","This is a very thorough account of the years 1917-21 Ukraine, and the attempts of Nestor Makno and his anarchist populist army to liberate their country from first, the czarist, counter-revolutionary (""white"") army, and then the traitorous Bolsheviks, who attacked the ""Maknovites"" from behind, (after having taken control of the Revolution, strangling it to death in the name of ""the international proletariat.""A solid piece of scholarship, stands up well against the other historical accounts, (i.e. the official Soviet slander, and others of dubious moral character).Not as well written as say, Emma Goldman's ""My Disillusion in Russia,"" or Alexander Berkman's ""The Bolshevik Myth"" (which gives a more-intimate, first-person account); but a stand-out historical marker.One can only hope that Nestor Makno's extensive auto-biography will soon be published in English."
4,Burton,Wonderful!!!,"This is my absolute favorite CD. I like just about every song on here (""Jumper"" is my favorite, although ""Losing A Whole Year"" and ""How's It Going To Be"" tie for a close second.) This CD is definitely not repetitive, and the lyrics are easy to relate to. I highly recommend it."
3,Fridley,The Pope of Greenwich Village,Check this out!! The frigging DVD doesn't work at all. I have tried this piece of crap in three DVD players and the frigging DVD does not work. What is the address to Amazon to get my money back. I strongly recommend not buying this piece of crap.
1,Brookfield,Failed after a couple months using it as a,Ordered this drive to use with Windows 7 readyboost in mid 2010. It was dead within a month or so and wouldn't function whatsoever.
4,Annapolis,"Philosophy, mystery and history all rolled into one book!","An amazing concept for a book. It's a mystery story (who is the mysterious philosophy teacher?), a history of philosophy told in terms that are both simple to understand and deeply thought provoking. It also leaves the reader with a myriad of intellectual conundrums.This has to be one of the most fascinating books of recent times."
3,Brookfield,dried potatoes,"I really did not like these potatoes at all. I thought they tasted worse than most of the others I've tried. I have to admit that I am a fan of whole potatoes, but I like to keep a box of potato flakes on hand. My husband likes dried potatoes, but he did not like these."
3,Brookfield,"phone doesn't work, not reliable, expected better from sony","The phone seemed great, answering machine had problems with cutting off parts of message... after 1 week, battery just wouldn't work, even though phone had not been away from base cradle except for actual phone calls. Replacing battery at my own cost did not fix. I returned item as faulty and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Kenmore,It's the guitariest!,"I'm not surprised at all the negative reviews here, because this album is different, which scares people. It rocks, it sputters, it lurches. It's hard. It sounds broken and industrial. The guitars are insane, all over the place. Even Josh Homme's vocals are different than anything he's ever done before.So if you want to hear Songs for the Deaf Part II, don't buy this album. If you want to hear an album that's fresh and exciting and exactly what rock and roll should sound like in 2008, then pony up for this masterpiece. Best QOTSA album ever."
2,Kenmore,This book is junk,"I'm a UC Davis student who took the plant biology course that uses this book. The professor doesn't even follow the book because it's so bad. It's unorganized, confusing, and useless for my class. Even some of the illustrations in the book are wrong. Don't buy this book if you just plan to learn plant biology. If you have to buy this book because course requirement, good luck"
4,Burton,Too good to be real,All these episodes of the Tudors are great ! Story and cast are awesome even if it is not totally accurate account of history...
3,Fridley,a good but long book,"Executive orders is not the best tom clancy novel but is a very good one. Its 1300+ pages set up a good ending but it takes a long time to get to it. If you can't stomach a long read i don't reccomend this book, however, if you are looking for a book to get really caught up in this is your book. Overall i thought it was a good book."
4,Mansfield,Cheap and Chic,this is a really smart and cute guide for us young twenty somethings that are just getting started. it has great tips and advice on what areas to splurge on and how to love large on a budget. alot of things are common sense but it's still a cute book
4,Annapolis,Grape Jelly,"i love jan morris' take on our 16th president. she compares him to grape jelly at the beginning of the book, and at first has readers scratching their heads. but you will soon find out why the comparison is used if you dive in and keep reading. i love this biography, morris is one of my favorite authors and it is definitely work reading over and over again. great book."
4,Sun City Center,My new gym :-D,"Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout."
5,Lancaster,More than just the canon,"pachelbel's canon is so lovely that i always figured he must have written other good chamber music. but until this album i'd failed to find it. the trio sonatas and parties are pleasant melodies and make gratifying listening.the album also, inevitably?, contains the canon. but here too there's a reward. the canon was popularized by a viennese string orchestra that toured the us c. 1973 and played the canon at a 6-7 minute pace, yet today's chamber performers prefer a pace of about 2.5 to 3 minutes. this rendition is nearly 4 minutes and done with a liveliness of tone that reminds us why the canon is fun."
4,Annapolis,Super!,"one of the most beautiful songs and real heart breaking voice. if you like this genre, you'll love it!"
1,Kenmore,Wrong sizes sent,"I received this set as a Christmas present. Much to my surprise, and dismay, they did not send the right sizes. I received a 1T, 1.5T and 1.5 teaspoon. My set is missing the largest scoop. I hope to get my large scoop sent and return the small one. Otherwise the entire set is going back."
3,Orland Park,great collection of short horror stories,"If you like fast-paced short stories, this is the book for you. It was my first Stephen King reading. ""The Ledge"" continues to haunt my memory."
5,Annapolis,As A Poet!,"As a poet I duelly enjoyed this ""poem"". it had more substance then domew of the plays I have read recenttly. I really like the dept and character of Shange's women, and their ideas. I was moved by the honest approach to the way things were/are. I applaud this wonderful book and give it two thumbs up!"
2,Annapolis,0 star if I could select it....,"Kiyosaki is a mediocre story teller at best and an even worse financial/life adviser. I'm no expert but I suspect he suffers from multiple personality disorders. It's obvious that all the stuff he talks about his rich dad and Mike and himself are made B.S. The materials reads/sounds like as if 4(the 2-dads, Mike and him) of his multiple personalities are talking to one another and he has the insight and bravado to put it down on paper and make a fortune out of it. Someone once told me that if you package feces right, you can sell it. Kiyosaki's books are proof of that.PZ"
1,Orland Park,A huge waste of time.,"This album offers nothing new and exciting at all. Bush were a (still are? thats if they are still together, maybe)resepectable band.Everything about this album is a drudge and drag. The guitars are heavy, but with no edge or buzz, just a big fat lazy noise, and none of the songs really offer anything great, just loud guitar riffs with the odd interlude or unsurprising intro, all the while lacking any real identity or direction.Why Bush have disentergrated is a mystery, they were a great band and while their last two albums did not make such an impact as their first two, they still were excellent, not surprisingly they were totally ignored in favour of commercial nonsense instead - BORING!!!It will be interesting to see whether Gavin Rossdale will reform Bush to make another album..... in what another 7 or 6 years? More than likely."
3,Eastchester,I LOST MY MONEY,"THE CD ARRIVED ON TIME, BUT I EXPECTED A TANGO CD AND IT TURNED TO BE FULL OF BALLADS AND SONGS. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT IN THE BOOKLET INSIDE. IT'S ONLY ONE FOLDED PAPER WITH THE NAME OF THE SINGER AND THE TITLES. NO MUSICIANS, NO ORCHESTRA NAME, NO COMPOSERS NAME. VERY DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I THINK I WON'T LISTEN TO DE CD ONCE MORE. I HARDLY WENT THROUGH HALF OF IT, AND IT SOUNDS ALL THE SAME."
4,Orland Park,Truly Excellent for all Viewers,"Many movies have appeal for mostly one type of person-- young kids, teenagers, adults, men, women, dog people, non-dog people.This movie is quite remarkable in that it really is outstanding for anyone. Really..Wonderful story with a lot of depth. Good acting, memorable characters, humor, action, moral decisions to be made, definite but subtle lessons to be learned no matter who you are.Five star rating. Ten if I could.."
3,Marysville,"In a word, ""crap.""","Cheaply made, very flimsy. Stopped working two months after I bought it. I ended up buying the Canon RS-80N3 Remote Switch. Which is of very high quality and very overpriced. But at least it works."
2,Eastchester,OK for light home use but not heavy duty use.,"We purchased two of these racks to use at our charity rummage sales. Unfortunately, they were not as sturdy and durable as they claimed to be. We barely had 100 lbs of clothes on the racks and one of them broke during the first use. One of the bars broke off completely. We were very disappointed in this purchase."
3,Fort Lauderdale,Let down.,"Don't get me wrong I found a few parts funny, but overall this movie was a letdown and I feel I could have watched something more entertaining. It could have been the mood I was in when I viewed the movie."
4,Bridgewater,Flight,"The airplanes that I made from this book, once finished, were simply amazing. I picked the ""dart"" models because they looked easier to make. The downside - the directions are a little hard to figure out. This would have been a great DVD - it would be easier to actually see someone making the planes."
4,Bridgewater,Awesome Strawberries,"The plants arrived moiste and ready for planting. I received 50 plants and 45 of them are doing very well. Since this is a bare root product I expected some to not make it, but here it is a week later and they are growing every day and already new leaves are sprouting. I found this same strawberry plant at my local nursery for $2.50 a plant! I expect nothing but great berrys from these plants. Thank You"
3,Wausau,"AMAZING, BEST BOOK I EVER READ","When getting this book in the mail with a bunch of other books, I picked this one up and thought, ""Why did my mother buy me this boring and long book?"" One day I picked it up and started to read it, and I couldn't put it down. It was probably the best book I ever read! Now my friend has borrowed it from me. I can't wait to read the second: ""Rebel Angels!"""
1,Marysville,Not worth the money,"This game has no similarity at all to D&D; and I found the title to the game misleading.Hero development is mundane and sorely limited.If you are looking for a D&D; game, this is definitely not it.Game is pretty repetive and limited."
3,Pensacola,Trays good for sensitive teeth,"I've had to stay away from products like these due to the sensitivity caused by the process. However, about a year ago, my dentist recommended putting fluoride gel(which I purchase form the dentist) into ""my trays"" after bleaching to relieve the pain only to be frustrated that ""my trays"" would have to be custom made at a price I was not willing to pay. (FYI: For reviewers that complain about gum bleaching, this is the answer to your woes because the trays will fit your teeth perfectly and not get bleach goo on your gums) I was very excited that Aquafresh introduced these trays because after I bleach, I can rinse out the trays and put in the fluoride gel for as long as I can stand. This has solved my sensitive teeth problems, and now I can bleach as often as I like."
2,Marysville,COMMERCIAL RAP,"WHAT HAPPEN TO HOUSTON. H-TOWN USE TO BE A MAVERICK FOR ORIGINALITY. WILLIE D, GETO BOYS THEN DJ SCREW WERE ALL INNOVATORS THAT KEPT HOUSTON ON THE MAP. TODAY THERES NOTHING BUT WACKED RAP COMING OUT OF HOUSTON. COME ON NOW, ALL YOU EVER HEAR IS PURPLE SYRUP, WOOD GRAIN, CHANGIN LANES, CANDY PAINT, ETC... OVER AND OVER ON TRACK AFTER TRACK ON CD AFTER CD. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ALL OF THIS BEFORE. LIKE OVER 10 YEARS AGO. THIS CD IS NO EXCEPTION. IT COMES OFF SOUNDING LIKE SOME KIND OF DEMO. SO PLEASE, WILL YOU WACK PEOPLE STOP BUYING THESE WACK CDS' AND STOP SUPPORTING WACKED RAP."
4,Kenmore,Need a Kindle version of the book,"i just loved the book, whether it was written well or not so well, but i would like to see it in a kindle version, so i can have it with me in my purse.thank you."
4,Sun City Center,Brians Wilderness,"Brian Robinson is back out in the wild again. Brian can not adjust to his normal life at home. Brian decides to start to head out on a journey to meet the small horns (The People Who Saved Him). Brian encounters many things like being shot in the leg with his own arrow. Brian was heading down the river on his journey. When he stopped to look at a bear that was looking at him. The bear started to charge and Brian, Brian jumped out on to dry land. Will Brian be able to fight off the bear?"
2,Holt,Very Brief Nudity,"You get a couple quick glimpses of topless nudity every once in a while. Theres a good strip routine near the end, but its so dark that you dont see much when she finally takes off her top. you get a few glimpses, you will find more skin flicks than this."
4,Pensacola,Pink Martini?,Pink Martini fan? Now you know where your favorite vocalist went. Pepe's new band is awesome.
2,Parma,It doesn't work for everyone!,"What the book doesn't tell you is that if you are not obese, you will not see the results described. I have been in ketosis/lipolysis for 3 months and have lost only 3 pounds. I couldn't understand what was happening and my doctor said that the diet works only for people who are significantly overweight (I wanted to lose only 10-15 pounds). Also, my blood pressure went through the roof! My previously obese sister had a great experience, but not me!"
1,Burton,ugh,"I didn't realize when i ordered this that it was the ""neuter"" version, which means they basically took all the great stuff out, I would deff recommend paying a few extra dollars for the unrated version, this is just SAD."
3,Sayreville,"A brave, gut wrenching confessional","I first saw Martin Moran perform a version of his story as a one man play in Manhattan. When his off hand geniality, warmth and humor suddenly segued into the story of a young gay boys sexual abuse by a Catholic Brother, it hit the audience like a bolt out of the blue. The book goes into even greater depth. If you can't see this incredibly talented theater guy tell his story, this book is the next best thing."
3,Pensacola,Firefighter Puppet!,purchased for my daughter's friend as a birthday gift and she absolutely loves it. i would highly recommend these puppets. they are great quality for the price.
3,Pensacola,they work,"These are some of the better earbuds out there. They don't hurt (as some earbuds do), and the wrap-around feature keeps them in your ears (for when you decide to overreach the length of the cord).The nicest thing about is the length. I can now listen to the radio on my desk and still reach the drawers in my cubicle without having to take them off. Wonderful!I would recommend these to anyone who has suffered the standard length of earbuds."
4,Sayreville,A must-read,"There is nothing boring, old or unoriginal about Jason Fforde's ""The Eyre Affair"". From the first page to the last, you will be spellbound by his seemingly limitless imagination. I personally am drawn to the world where people live and breathe literature (perhaps a satire on today's world, where technology is the be-all and end-all of our lives?). I haven't read all the books mentioned in the novel, but by the time I reached the end of the story, I was raging to go, buy and read them! On top of being a hilarious and fast-paced detective/adventure story, I find this book to be a loving tribute to the world of reading and literature, and it will certainly encourage you to read more."
4,Holt,Great Drive,"Great for TimeMachine back ups. Already formated for Apple Mac systems. Runs quite and cool. Looks great too, matches the PowerMac G5 case."
1,Sun City Center,This is a 1 CUP press,"12 ounces = about the size of a Tall Starbucks coffee.I'm not sure in what universe Bodum lives that they call a 12 ounce press ""3 cups"". (in the end it makes about 10 ounces, if you think about the space for the grounds).I'm doing Bodum a service by making consumers aware of this so you can avoid buying it and they can avoid your complaints, if you're looking for a press that gives you more than 1 cup of coffee."
1,Eastchester,"Jurassic Park & Spielberg - Best Selling, Best Director??","OK, the devil posessed me at this very point when I'm writing this. But I''ve always felt this way anyhow.... If no one in the world has said this before, may I be the first.Jurassic Park is one hell of a disaster. Those who made this should be eradicated from earth. The biggest turkey in cinema history (and let us not forget the giant pelicans too), if you're buying this because of its achievements in special effects and sounds then count yourself as someone who has no clue at all what cinema is about. A film that is simply a waste of time and talent.As for Spielberg voted as the No.1 director in AFI (?)'s Best Director list, are you kidding??"
5,Orland Park,WRONG INFORMATION FOR ITEM,"love chronicles - love in the old west was an episode in an a&e; documentary series in 2000. it's not a movie and the above information is completely incorrect.the item description is correct. ""a chronicle of one of the most romanticized eras in american history. meet pioneer descendants, real-life mountain men, and native americans who tell their love stories and relive tales of romance among the outlaws and gunslingers of the frontier. john corbett (""northern exposure"") hosts""the credits are entirely wrong. they belong to the movie, ""love chronicles"" which is a different item. also, after reading the reviews - they all seem to belong to the movie as well. i hope someone from amazon can fix it."
2,Holt,NEVER RECEIVED ITEM,I NEVER receivd this item from the 3rd party seller. I WILL NEVER use this service again. I will go to my local Barnes/Nobles. I waited THREE weeks after the agreed upon date and have yet to see the product. BAD SERVICE!!!!!
4,Lancaster,Fairly good shape,love the story. recieved the book fairly quickly. some writting on the cover as well as inside the book. the binding of the book was weel worn but seems to be holding up well for a used paper-back.
1,Fort Lauderdale,Poor Gilbert :-(,"Poor Gilbert! He must have turned over in his grave every day since this monstrosity was created.Removing the opera from Japan and dressing the characters in British 1920s formal attire takes Mikado out of context, and renders it humorless and senseless.Gilbert was a genius. The creator of this perversion is not!"
2,Wausau,Wheels no longer move in front!!,"The wheels on this stroller no longer roll, after very little use, maybe 10 times. They lock up and you have to pop-a-wheelie to move the stroller.I will NEVER by another Kolcraft. Wheel technology is hundreds of years old. This should not be happening in the 21st Century!"
2,New Windsor,Broken Toy - Broken Heart,"Purchased two of these for my grandson, and would have purchased the entire set. Weapons did not fit hands of figures, and the hands fell out of the sockets, and, of course, they're now missing. The figure did not even last 24 hours. Flawed design and poor construction. I won't purchase any more Bandai toys, and the ones I purchased for Christmas are being returned."
3,Kenmore,Dull Mission for the Killmaster,"Carter is in the Mideast trying to find out who is mobilizing Muslims against the West. Unfortunately,action is set aside so Carter can trade quips and bed down a KGB spy he's on friendly terms with. Yawn!"
2,Wausau,Slow and unstable,The BEFCMU10 (Version 3.0) cable modem is not Linksys' best product. It is unstable (requires a reset about twice a week) and has long latency under high traffic. I was running a Voice Over IP connection over this cable modem. I had poor performance and poor reliability.Replaced this with a Motorola Surfboard SB5120. The SB5120 performs much better with much lower latency. Greatly improves the quality of my VOIP service and never requires a reset.Wait for a new release (version 4.0?) or buy a SB5120.
3,Burton,"only works as a charger, does not hot sync Tungsten E2","This cable is not for the Tungsten E2, it is for a Treo 600. It has no hot sync button and will not hot sync through software despite what they assert. Don't get it."
4,Elmwood Park,Good knife needs work,The ribbing on side wears off on change in pocket. Also the saw attachment has no indentation on it to open.
3,Bridgewater,Be Afraid...Be Very Afraid!!!!,"Bar none the worst business machine I've ever owned.Like others have said, single faxes have to be forced into the slot to hopefully get them to feed. Multiple sheets go through three or four at a time. A complete waste of your money. I'm dumping it for a Brother 4100e."
2,Eastchester,Not for me,"While I can appreciate fratire, I did not really care for this book. I rated it with two stars as some people may appreciate the book, however it wasn't for me. In my opinion I found it to be degenerate."
5,Sayreville,Not cheap but convenient,You could put something like this together for much less than it costs but if you're short on time then these straps do the trick. I use them on all tall/heavy furniture that's at risk of toppling in an earthquake or if baby climbs on them. They come in enough colors that I can match them to to the furniture and they don't look too bad.
2,Parma,No way would this pen hold any dog,"This was the flimsiest piece of junk ever. Reviews claiming that it holds their 50lbs rambunctious puppy must be fake, or the product has been redesigned. After assembly, even the lightest touch knocked this over. The pen either would tip over or fold in on itself. On top of the poor quality of the product, the return shipping through UPS is obscene -- it will cost over half the original price of the pen.I'm not sure how so many people can give this product such a positive review..."
3,Wausau,Incestuous filth,"Unfortunately I bought the trilogy after reading The Other Boleyn Girl thinking that all of this authors works would be good. I was wrong. I read this book and the start of the next, The Favored Child, and it is all disgusting. Honestly, I don't know who would enjoy this kind of rag."
4,Burton,This book is actually ' Present of the Past',this is my first book by elizabeth adler and i love it.it is a gripping story full of strong emotions. i wonder why it has not been spotted by any film producer to make into a movie. i'm sure your readers would enjoy it.
2,Sun City Center,great disappointment,"I've read a number of Koontz books and have enjoyed them a great deal, but Fear Nothing is probably the worst book that I've tried to read in many, many years.The storyline would have been good, but the story telling made it impossible for me to read and enjoy. I found myself skimming page after page, trying to get to the good parts. The good parts were few and far between, unfortunately.The book has far too much flowery, needless, in-depth descriptions of the most mundane things that did nothing to make the story anything but a chore for me to read.I'd intended to buy the sequel, but I am afraid to waste the money on it."
3,Brookfield,One of the best and most comprehensive budgie books around.,"REVIEW: Excellent! One of the best and most comprehensive budgie books around. This is a MUST HAVE for all parakeet owners! As a budgie owner and breeder, I have referred to it often. Nice pics and diagrams. Includes a fantastic section (25 pages!) on breeding. Plus an informative chapter on Health Care and Diseases. Subjects also covered include Diet, Purchasing and Housing, and Behavior, among others. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"
3,Mansfield,TWO DAYS,"two days is how long it took me to read this book. i am usually a.d.d. when it comes to reading, taking me a few weeks to read a good sized novel. however, angels and demons is a breathtaking attention getter that was far more interesting and suspenseful than any television program i could have watched instead. i sat for hours reading chapter after chapter. there is not a single lull in the book in which to get bored with. i was fascinated by all of the religious symbolism and how mosty accurate dan brown was with the inner workings of the catholic church. i highly reccommend this book to lovers of mystery, suspense, science fiction, and adventure."
4,Burton,Buffy Rocks!!!!!,This game is awsome. This new software company is Impressive very Impressive...Definite must get for Buffy Fans...
3,Bridgewater,One Star is One Too Many,"The remaining members of Styx from its vintage days are long on pettiness and short on talent. Nothing more than bland, middle of the road, totally unimaginative tripe. Dennis De Young made Styx Styx, for better or worse. Now that he's gone, it's clear it was for better. Save your money and buy ANYTHING else - Madonna, Backstreet Boys, anything!"
3,Parma,Free at Last,I did not receive the book yet. I am still waiting on it. When will it be shipped. Thanks.
4,Bridgewater,My First Review After bin Laden's Death,"I think the cover and title of Overkill's EP re-issue are a perfect message for the dead, water-logged terrorist. The song title Rotten to the Core applies to Osama 'has-been' Laden as well, and don't forget Fatal If Swallowed...as in a Navy SEAL bullet! Finally, it might be true that Evil Never Dies, as the song title suggests, but it CAN get dumped into the sea to nourish the bottom-feeders. May 1, 2011 was a day to remember.As for an actual review, I like the cd a lot. It has the classic F*** You EP, Hole in the Sky and Evil Never Dies live, and their self-titled, out-of-print debut EP. If you're looking for F*** You anyway, I don't know why you wouldn't go for the re-issue with its twelve tracks. So, in summary, Overkill rules, bin Laden's dead, and screw terrorism."
5,Sun City Center,a typical 90's rock album,"I bought this album knowing almost nothing about elastica, but i found it in the bargain bin of a record store used for 3 dollars, so i decided to give it a try. i didnt know what to expect- and i got something that sounds like something Hole would do. it sounds like its straight from the mid 90's- but also has some 80's influences, melodies, and harmonies. its not a masterpiece, but it is a pretty solid album if you want a good uptempo album. My favorite song is probably track number 5, Smile. The songs arent really that diverse and sometimes cant tell them apart. It is almost like a female empowerment album. So if you like the rocking sounds of hole, try this album. after listening, it kind of reminded me of veruca salt- another great female led rock band. this album is worth a try."
1,Burton,How did this Cd make it to the top ten?,"The song `It's going down' was an ear catching tune. Other than that the album is horrible. I was very irritated after the fourth or fifth song. I agree with a previous comment that P. Diddy (Puffy, Sean Combs or whatever he's calling himself these days) is getting yet another quick buck. He did it for Loom, Black Rob, G. Dep, and the list goes on and on. Yung Joc does not represent the south at all; maybe his neighborhood in College Park, but defiantly not the south in a whole. Don't waste your time and effort purchasing this CD, just borrow it from your little sister or brother."
3,Sayreville,Good Waffles,"Bought this unit for the wife. We have other Cuisinart appliaces; coffee maker and convection toaster oven. This unit works well, first time making waffles we set it to light, but the second time, we made them darker, it was great. Don,t forget to spray with a lil Pam......Making them is fun, but for me, eating them is better......"
3,Pensacola,"A brilliant, under appreciated album","The songwriting is wonderful. I came across a promo copy and neglected it for years; when I finally gave it some attention, I was amazed. I've since lost that copy, so I've just bought another. It seems to be out of print. It's a shame that no one seemed to notice this great album."
3,Elmwood Park,Scanner and Fax Broke down after 2 years,Don't buy this printer. I bought it for around $360 and after 2 years it is just a piece of junk. Do not buy any Canon's MP830. Not worth the money.
1,Eastchester,Disappointing to Miles fan,"You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan. The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the album a light, airy feeling. Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment. You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music. I would call this a ""pleasant"" album, which in my jazz-world is not a happy thing."
3,Holt,Charlie Brown Christmas without Linus? Hmmmmm,"I bought these figures, thinking they were Christmas ornaments. I was a bit surprised that they had clip on key ring attachments. No problem, simply remove the key rings and put ornament hangers on them.These ""ornaments"" would be great bits of nostalgia, except they forgot to include Linus. They include a piano, but no Linus. Imagine, a Charlie Brown Christmas with nobody to play the carols.All in all, they rate a 2 for the silly key rings and no Linus. If marketed as ornaments and had a Linus, they would get 5 stars!"
4,Pensacola,Does the job,"Although not quite the right size for my wall heater, it does the job I needed it to do. Worth the price and now i can control; my heater"
3,Burton,James Bond 007: Nightfire,"This in its own right is the first game that truly gives the true bond expierence. I enjoyed it more than every James Bond game exept for Goldeneye. Every Bond game has lived in its shadow and so does Nightfire, but not as much as the rest of the bond titles. Goldeneye is the best bond in my opinion, but doesn't give the best impression of the charismatic James Bond himself. This game is more like a James Bond movie than a game and really develops every character and shows the side of James Bond as much as a movie does.Nightfire is about a Japanese based company that hopes in changing world government in favor for one government thatcontrols the planet with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and 007 of MI6 is the last hope for the world. The graphics are a ten out of ten. Pierce Brosnan looks almost real and the voice overs are really good. This is a very realistic first person shooter that no Gamecube owner should be without."
4,Marysville,Excellent,i love how interactive it is. my daughter is learning a lot by using it. we've had it a month and she still likes it which says a lot!
2,Lancaster,y did u have to desapoint us????,"sorry but this iz not wirth it!!! get some lyrics, beats r'nt that good either"
3,Orland Park,bass,"nice sound but doesn't have a really rich bass sound , really expected more sound out of them,, but love the design"
4,Sayreville,As Advertised,"It's reasonably priced, easy to use, works exactly as advertised and saved me time, inconvenience and money the first week I had it.I wish I could say that about everything I bought."
2,Sun City Center,organic argan oil,I have been using this product for over 2 weeks. I do not see any change in my skin as far as less wrinkled or more moisture.I have not tried it on my hair.
2,Parma,A False Book,"""A Conversation"" type book has to be taken as fiction; but acceptable fiction. In other words the characters have to be represented truthfully and convincingly.After a page of this I was trouble by what I was reading. After flipping through the book I was angry at reading what is being represented as Oscar Wilde.This book is a self-indulgent exercise in piousness."
1,Holt,Good Book...Except for the bugs,"I am using this book for a class on Catholic Social Teaching, and it is very useful. By containing the encyclicals, constitutions, and other documents of Catholic Social Teaching along with some commentary and background provided by the authors, it gives great insight into what all Catholics should be focusing on.The bad thing however was that when I received my book in the mail it had tiny black bugs all over it, inside and out. I had to throw it away as I couldn't get rid of the bugs and did not want them in my house.Unfortunately this has made it a little bit difficult given that I need the book for class, however all the documents in the book can be obtained on the Vatican's and the USCCB's website for free. All that you are lacking is the small commentary by the authors of the book for each document, you will still get the text of the Church teaching from the websites and not have to pay anything for it."
4,Parma,absolutely great,these binoculars enable you to see terrific detail of objects from a distance. the detail of pike's peak from colorado springs is so great through these it's unbelievable for a pair so compact. as another person stated they are too good for say a ball game but superb for long distance like on a 4x4 trail.
2,Elmwood Park,nowhere near as good as the first.............,"this one surprised me, it wasn't nearly as good as the first moment after movie. it started out ok, but then got bogged down and kinda fizzled. very few, if any, special effects, just didn't seem to have much to say. not only that, they left everything up in the air, i guess so they have to make part 3! i just hope part 3 will not dissapoint like this one did. i still love brad, david & kevin tho......they're always a treat to watch, even in this clunker! they're awesome in six-the mark unleashed! (read my review of that one)teresa s."
2,Holt,Not designed to last,"We didn't use ours very much, but it still broke after 9 months. The bottom seal sprang a major leak after the olive oil was refilled (below the line, as the directions require) and just a single pump press was made. Maybe the oil was eating away the adhesive used by the manufacturer? Anyway, it's not so good to be left with an oily mess on your counter."
3,Burton,Dependent on a perfect world,"I am a renovation contractor. I have used a certain pocket door hardware set (that starts with ""J""). Not being available, I purchased this set. It works okay and is similar to the other brand with one critical exception: the latching hardware that attaches to the top of the door allowing for removal is low grade plastic as opposed to metal.I had this plastic latch freeze in place so that I couldn't get the door out for further tweaking. The plastic latching arm would bend and distort but not release from the attachment post of the roller bearing. We tried everything...ended up having to cut it out with a sawzall(!) and obtain a replacement part. I do not believe this situation would have occurred with the metal latch of the competition's product, making it superior IMO."
2,Pensacola,Junk...Desn't Fit ! Don't buy from here !,I blame Amazon for using a cheap vendor like CableMark. They sell junk. I have a Nikon 880 (baby brother of 990 I use at work. They BOTH use the UC-E1 cable (yes my manual says so too). What I received from CableMark (through Amazon) does NO FIT my camera OR the 990 model at work.First and last time I will shop at Amazon.
4,Wausau,good,"when I first heard ""christmas shoes"" it made me cry. My mom had died recently and it just touched my heart. Glad I had the chance to buy it. They even through in a new case, as the case it is in is cracked.thanks."
3,Fort Lauderdale,Doctoral thesis,"This is the doctoral thesis of H.G. Richter, one of the foremost wood anatomists of our time and a specialist in Lauraceae. Illustrated by black&white photomicrographs (mostly taken by light microscope but also some by electron microscope) and a few color photographs.Contains a wealth of information on the wood and bark anatomy of Lauraceae. However, note that Lauraceae is a family in which a considerable amount of work has been done since 1981.For a brief survey of the anatomy of Lauraceae in English by the same author see ""Anatomy of the Dicotyledons, 2nd ed., Vol 3"" (1987)."
5,Burton,excellent headset,"It works flawlessly with my HTC TyTN, HTC Advantage and the HTC Excalibur S621.I will buy it next time too.Happy customer."
2,Eastchester,"Retractable action not strong enough, making walking a chore!","The retractable action on this flexi leash is not strong enough, often causing a delay or sagging of the cord when you want it to take up some slack. This makes walking my dog extremely tedious, and dangerous. I also use a lightweight rubber extension to cushion the impact of a 'strong walker' (dog that pulls hard or makes a break for a rabbit, bird, etc.), and this flexi leash cannot handle it. The sagging occurs whether I use the extension or not, but is much worse with the extension. Flexi should manufacture these retractable leashes with a stronger springing action to make them more functional in the real world. I am hoping my pet retailer will take it back and refund me."
3,Burton,Master Bedrooms on First Floor,"I was disappointed because the majority of the plans in this book have the master bedroom on the ground floor. I've purchased 5 different new-build houses in the suburbs of NYC, Chicago and London and never come across a home with the master on the ground floor. Two realtor friends tell me they are unusual and difficult to resell unless in a retirement community. If you're looking for a ground floor master you'll probably find the book useful but anyone building a traditional house will probably be disappointed as I was."
5,New Windsor,Holiday Recipes From Breakfast to Late Snacks--Must Try!!,"I first checked this book out from the local library and picked out a few recipes to try for Thanksgiving prior to the Christmas holiday parties. I also took it to my mother for her to look at. She began writing down page numbers of recipes she want copies of too. After trying several of the recipes, which for the most part, were very easy, I decided I wanted this book in my home for year round entertaining. The craft and decorating ideas are also wonderful. I especially liked the tomato cage Christmas trees. It was simple to make and when I showed my friends they couldn't believe it--you have to see the pictures in the book to appreciate how simple and elegant they are and so inexpensive to make. For your holiday entertaining I strongly recommend this beautiful book."
4,Elmwood Park,Very pleased with fast service.....!!!!,"This was a birthday present for my grandaughter, I had been searching for and it was the final hour , I NEEDED IT.. not only did they have this but I also was able to purchase an additional one. The best part was the books arrived in time for the party...Grandma was saved."
5,Annapolis,"Charlie and Lola, Vol. 5 - But I Am an Alligator",the kids love watching charlie and lola for some reason and amazon seems to be the place where i can get the series at a reasonable price. the content itself is also very interesting so much so that the wife and i also began watching it with the kids. good time for bonding and teaching the kids about sharing and other values.
1,Mansfield,Pennies in a blender,"i can see how this album in an evolution of Mouse on Mars' experimental form of musical exploration. Yes, it has some artistic merit. But its not music. And its not enjoyable. Its noise. Headache-inducing, high-pitched, static-ridden noise. The same effect could be achieved by placing a handful of pennies in a blender, set to whip. Record that, randomly divide it up into tracks and you have Varcharz.A huge disappointment. I delete it and regret purchasing it.Ill take Radical Connector any day."
4,Elmwood Park,Awsome DVD,"This is one of the best opera I have ever seen. I have been waiting for the DVD release for many years, and finally its here!"
1,Lancaster,I'm Holding Out for Widescreen,"I was soooooo eager to buy the Sandra Dee Gidget flicks, and willing to purchase them individually, but when I found the series -- I was tickled, UNTIL I saw it was full screen!Horrors.To the person who stated that full screen is the only way to go, I would like to say that there have been many DVDs released with BOTH options, and that's my format preference -- and my suggestion to all who are creating DVDs from older flicks -- Please forget the fancy artwork on the actual CD, and burn both sides -- one in WIDESCREEN and the other, full if you want to to appeal to both.I will wait for the widescreen edition (until then, I'll maybe rent via netflix if I feel like a gidget fix)!"
1,Sun City Center,CERO EN CALIDAD,"TODAS LAS CANCIONES SUENAN IGUALES, CON LOS MISMOS SONIDOS Y TEMAS DE SIEMPRE. PARECE MAS UN DISCO QUE TOCARIAN EN CUBA COMUNISTA PARA TORURAR A ASESINOS Y A ENEMIGOS POLITICOS CONTRAREVOLUCIONARIOS. LA LEYENDA, EL MITO DE LA TREVI SE ACABO EL DIA QUE SE DESCUBRIO QUE TODO LO QUE DECLARO EN EL SHOW DE CRISTINA ERAN MENTIRAS Y ENCUBRIMIENTOS DE ""LA REBELDE DEL PELO LARGO"" PARA PROTEGER A SU MACHO, EL TAL SERGIO ANDRADE, QUE POSEE PODERES SOBRENATURALES Y CON UNA GRAN ENVERGADURA QUE LO HACE INMUNE A TODA ENFERMEDAD PERO QUE SE ALIMENTA CON LA VIRGIINIDAD DE LAS POBRES INOCENTES.

2,Brookfield,I Say A Prayer for Me: ONe Woman's Life of Faith And Triumph,The writer gives the impression that you can overcome herion addiction just by praying and becoming a member of the 700 club.
5,Fridley,great bandsaw,"I searched a long time trying to make up my mind on which bandsaw to purchase to replace my aging 12"" craftsman. It came down to the Jet and the Grizzly. I went with the Grizzly becase of budget restraints and I am not sorry that I did. I have only been using it for about a month and so far I think it is a great machine. I used the old craftsman for 20 plus years and now I see what I have missed. There is little to no vibration, the cuts are stright and the cut off pieces are fairly smooth. I am using a 3/16"" blade as I do fime detailed work. I have not done any resawing as of yet Bu I am sure there will be no problems.I was a little leary of having it shipped rather than going to a retail store, but the saw arrived in excellent condition and a lot sooner than I had expected. I would have no problems recommending this saw to anyone."
5,Marysville,A bit too similar to Batman,"When I saw the movie at day one in Germany, my anticipation for the movie score was very high, especially because I enjoyed the ""Batman Returns"" music score by Danny Elfman. However, I recognized lots of similarities to the one of Spider-Man. Maybe too many. For example the chorus or the dark brass. But there's still enough stuff in the music that brings individuality to it. My favourite tracks are ""Main Titles"", ""Costume Montage"", ""Parade Attack"" and ""Farewell"". Still, the action-stressed tracks are, in my opinion, too similar to the Batman theme. That's why I give it only four stars."
3,Fort Lauderdale,Loved it,i have yet to find a roberts trilogy that i haven't liked and am partial to the fantastical. i loved all three of these.
2,Mansfield,Not helpful. Not that funny either.,"If you are looking for a simple,common sense introduction to Kabbalah by someone with a sense of humor and perspective on his subject, you will find this book a disappointment. I don't know much about Kabbalah and, after reading this book, I still don't.On the other hand, if it is wit, satire and parody you seek, you will find yourself reading page after page waiting to get the joke. Kabbalah is mysterious enough without having to solve the mystery of what this author was attempting to accomplish."
4,Marysville,Own The Net,I have several James Jensen Tennis DVD instructionals and this is my favorite. With the help of this DVD I have gone from a timid vollyer to an agressive take no prisoners net attacker. My new style of play has increased my wins and gotten me more respect on the court. Very good instruction that will definetly help your volley game.
4,Wausau,Informational,this has a lot of great information in it. it is engaging and tells some great stories. any dino lover would appreciate this cd
1,Mansfield,Not what expecting,"I selected this rating because this Sports Bra was not what I was expecting at all. This was an extremely uncomfortable product and the fabric felt like sandpaper -- it was very abrasive. I'm not sure that it would not have caused intense chafing if I had done more than tried it on. The construction also involves elastic on the edge between the ""wing"" and the bra strap which created an obvious puckering of the fabric, even when being worn. The puckering showed through to my shirt. I probably could have ignored that unattrative effect if I hadn't had the sanding sensation. Since some of the fabric was reminiscent of window screen mesh, I am sure that all of the wicking properties were as stated. There were some aspects of the over-all construction that seemed like they would be beneficial -- such as some supportive padding at the base of each cup."
1,Fridley,Very disappointed...,"I started this book thinking it would be a light-hearted and fun with a little bit of mean, socialite humor. I was very disappointed because the main character goes from good to bad to worst. Starting out as an admired, wealthy woman, she ends the book willing to take any means necessary for revenge. I know books don't all end happily, but this one had no redeeming qualities. Wish I hadn't spent the time."
2,Marysville,i found the SOLITAIRE tracks,"after much searching of german websites i discovered that SOLITAITE cut an album in 1994 called Fearless on Recycle or Die/Eye Q records...these labels are no longer producing music....but if you look for these record labels...u will find SOLITAIRE-Fearless w/ the song awakening, tribes, soleil,eclipse...all i can say is do your research."
5,Kenmore,webtv keyboard,Have received was in very good shape also received batteries with keyboard.Very nice ! (:Thank you.Very happy with my order and was receieved in 2 days of order placement.
4,Bridgewater,Sweet Euroangel.,"There's no one like Basia--mebbe Sade or Lemmieux from the Groove Theory are closely cut, but there's only one Basia. And thank the spirits for that. This CD will be well worth the listener's money--you may wanna buy a couple of them because you'll wear it out--every cut is so fresh and new it's like heaven. I originally thought kinda cheated because one of my faves ""Miles Away"" wasn't on this Greatest hits CD but, I quickly got over that. This is too good to complain about. She is really one of the best singers out there, per-i-od! I enthusiastically recommend you get this and experience her for yourself. Then, remember I told you so..."
4,Bridgewater,Fantastic Tool,"This works great, makes flipping a high quantity of items on the grill quickly a snap. Would recommend highly. Need to keep away from smaller children if you have them. Point at end is sharp. Great conversation piece as well with the guys."
4,Parma,Yeah,"Works great, better than some that I have gotten with mp3 players. Works with other stuff too. happy customer. ty"
4,Fridley,Gold Timex Bracelet Watch #T23161,"Watch is exactly what I wanted visually. It is beautiful and fits in a work and play environment. Fits a small wrist with links taken out. I only wish that the band was a little more heavier for the price. I expected solid links that definitely have weight, but have found they are hollow. Other than that minor detail it is a beautiful watch that I can wear to work and business functions."
2,Mansfield,take God out of it,"I found the reference to God unnecessary. Many people don't believe in God or don't want to get into the ethics of God making disabilities happen, with their children who read the book. It should have been left out. The scientific aspect was good but there are many other books that do a better job. Steer clear of this one-it was more of a parent trying to make come to terms with his own issues than a resource for a child."
2,Fort Lauderdale,What a joke...!,"If by this point you think this is a remarkable book, you either (a) are the woman who wrote it, or (b) you don't read very much. In this case it's probably both."
4,Pensacola,Good Reference for Wing Chun/Kenpo/Etc. Practitioners,"This book is very well translated and lays out the various techniques clearly (with a couple of exceptions). Students of Kung Fu, Kenpo, Ninjitsu, and similar styles will find much familiar material here, with some twists. Provides a good range of weapons defenses, from blades to handguns, and is quite comprehensive for its size."
4,Bridgewater,Buy it on LP,"""Warren Zevon"" is not just one of the best records of the '70s, it's one of the top five records of all time. The CD version isn't bad for a CD, but if you really want to know this record for all it can render, get a turntable (a Rega P3 is nice) and an LP copy. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.A six-star album."
4,Mansfield,The funniest book in history,"this is a true guide to life from mr. know it him self bart simpson , it tells you a lot of useful and un useful stuff about life and what to do in certain situation, also how to get to know girls how to make it in school , sex , religion ... every thing .the best part i like is the one about writing book reports , so funny man ,well if you like matt groening old stuff like the (life is hell) books you'll love this one , and if you like the simpson also get this one , i recommend to every body any age any where, also take a look at matt groening old stuff (life is hell) the are as good and funny as this one ."
2,Eastchester,The Truth,I don't mean to poke fun at this book but I'm only 16 and I could have written it better myself. This is truly a terrible novel. If you are looking for something to read that has teenage romance and hookups then just buy a Gossip Girl...it's the gift that keeps on giving...#7 is coming May 2004. Don't waste your time on this pathetic portrayal of teenage life.
1,Fort Lauderdale,Not a good cow bell,"My cow does not like this cow bell. It's WAY TOO BIG. I don't know what kind of cow they were thinking of, but I've been around a lot of cattle, and I've never seen one that needs a bell that's this big.Also, I had to jury-rig a clapper (the part that rings the actual bell). This one came without one. I guess they want you to buy that separately (and probably pay separate shipping!)"
4,Kenmore,A Must Own!,"This is one of my favorites--of any genre. I accidentally found it by following a link on Napster Radio, and I've been listening to it almost every day since.The guest appearance by Paul Simon is little more than a curiosity, in this case, but certainly not a distraction. The styles are wide and varied, from Salsa to Mambo to Jazz. The production values are the only thing that lets you know that this album was released in 2007, as the music defies a ""time"" of style.I would recommend this album to any fan of Latin music, whether you are a beginner or have spent many years listening to the genre."
4,Sun City Center,"Inspiring, Elegant, Thoughtful.","As a starting rider, this book set the tone for how I would like to approach the (if I may be so bold) 'philosophy of riding':* Care for the horse-man relationship* Develop mastery of self* Listen to (and learn from) the horse* Respect the process and the history* and more..Granted, there are many pieces of advice I'm not ready for (specifics on Cavaletti riding and so on). And other books have been more practical (for my level) with the how-tos.But no other book has touched me so deeply with the why-tos."
1,Bridgewater,Dont Buy,"This DVD Player will not play +R DVD's. The menu displaying DivX files on DivX DVD'x is horrible. The menu did not display well, the file names were shortened and the filing system was not how I had made the files when I made the DVD. Don't be fooled by the HDMI connection either, it makes absolutely no difference in picture quality. Toshiba should be ashamed to put their name on such an un-user-friendly product"
2,Fridley,Skippies!,"Amazon is out of my ridata / riteks so i got these to hold me over. No coasters so far, but the discs mess up in all 4 of our players. They stop and shake and skip and freeze now and then - all that good junk. Something to think about before you buy - the price is definately right, but the quality is questionable."
5,Holt,Great product,"Purchased for my new G2. Works great, fast upload to my computer. Read all reviews before purchasing and seems the Viking is the best."
2,Marysville,Have I Forgotten?,"Why no, Darryl, I do remember it was the Saudis that attacked us on 9/11. It would appear that you have forgotten since you believe Iraq was involved. Nice to see you making a nice hefty profit while our troops are dying on a daily basis. They don't even have adequate water to drink. Only in country music could the public be this naive. Shameful."
4,Sayreville,What the new Metallica should have been.,"Dark Tranquility is where US metal should have evolved to, but didn't. Right about the time of ...And Justice For All, metal seemed to be going in the right direction, which is exactly where Dark Tranquility took off from. If you want to hear a true experience in exquisite riffs and well placed guitar rythms, then this is the album to buy."
5,Elmwood Park,What The?,"This book found me one day and now has me totally in it's pages.Every little thing that was ever said and every problem ever created has some form of simplistic answer within it.What is Left, Right, Up or Down, Sideways Backwards, Full or Empty has some form answer and deffernce to it. But then again what is It?All those funny sayings that pass our lips everyday are included and a full on assult on your brain senses really makes the old grey matter think. It is a book to be picked up and put down as you simply cannot read it through without causing your brain to pass out!!!"
4,Sayreville,In response to chapter 1 questions,"We regret the error in chapter 1 and in the latest release of the book this has been corrected. Madhu, Daniel and I put a lot of work into this book and we hope you will read further than chapter 1. In this rapid paced world if we don't write to beta releases we end up with the second or even third book out, unfortunately that usually means second or third in sales as well regardless of technical content. We wrote to the beta and the best documentation available, also, all chapters where reviewed by an Oracle tech reviewer. We cover the features that we beileve are applicable to DBAs. We feel this is a great book, and hope you will too!"
4,Bridgewater,Cute book,"Fun to read. About an Inch worm who measures 1"" and his friends who help him measure fruits and vegetables. The friends are 1/2"", 1/3"", and 1/8""."
5,Sun City Center,GREAT ONE!!!!!,DENGUE FEVER is just plain amazing this cd is great i bought it as soon as it came out you will be amazed with what u hear i liked all of the songs i am always listening to DENGUE FEVER!! they just have to come out with another cd this was one great thing they made!!!
5,Burton,Mr.,Great product. This coffee pot is the best i have ever owned. It brews hotter then any of the other coffee makers I have owned. You a have full pot of coffee in 3 minutes. Fantastic !!!
4,Bridgewater,BEST VILBERT CD SO FAR,THis CD is basically a refinement of LUKE VILBERT'S solo CD on Mo Wax. The melodies and the textures are much improved so this cd does not have the monotony problem of his previous work. unfortunately the beats are a lot more tame. it sounds like hes been listening to some of the more boring and lame artists on ninja tune.there's also some decent spoken word kitch thrown in.hopefully vilbert will take some rythem cues from amon tobin. and explore more vocals next time.
4,Fort Lauderdale,Awesome book!,"This is an awesome book! A gilrfriend recommended ""Baby Bargains"" to me, and I was like "" why on earth would I need this"". But I skimmed through it at a local bookstore and found the authors had a lot of helpful hints. Since purchasing it my husband and I take this book when shopping for our baby. I don't agree with the reviewer that said you can get the same thing on the web. I have found that this book, coupled with consumer reviews found on BRU, are great and informative resources. The book is a must-have for new parents!"
4,Eastchester,This is a fantastic album,"Wow! What a great find this was. Every track is just awesome and the album is not repetitive, there is a lot of variety. This is one of the few albums I have that I can listen to over and over and enjoy it every time. The production and vocals on this album are top notch."
2,Annapolis,Read The Reviews,"Read the reviews and understand what you're buying before you pay [price] of your hard earned money for this book.Go to a bookstore and take a minute to thumb through the pages to see what's in it. And the cd in the back of the book? Forget it - it's an eval. copy. You get a few programs that work 'out of the box' but in order to use the cd in it's entirety you have to pay an additional $5.00 at a website in order to activate the 'pro' version - LAME.I wanted so much for this book to be what it advertised. I held out hope reading page after (fluff)page. I held out hope even after reading other reviews that trashed this book. I held out hope until I popped the cd into my computer and saw that the only thing John Chirillo revealed to me was that I wasted my time and money.If you take away only one thing in this review, take this:There are no shortcuts. Buy ""Hacking Exposed"", sit down in front of the computer, and do your homework. Good Luck"
5,Brookfield,This book should be on every beginner's shelf,"One of our most prolific chess writers, Eric Schiller has again produced a most useful volume in his usual clear and concise style. Not intended to be the last word on chess, the Encyclopedia fulfills its promise of extracting practical nuggets useful for beginners and intermediate players from his own experience, the classic chess literature, and tournament play. Dr. Schiller truly does have an encyclopedic knowledge of the game and cites cogent examples from classic and contemporary play to illustrate his points. This is an easy book to browse in, and the reader will invariably come away with some tidbit that will enhance his/her understanding of the general principles of openings, middle game, end game, tactics,and strategy. Especially recommended for serious beginners."
3,Holt,Great....when it worked,Saw a huge difference when it actually worked. The cable itself is of extremely low quality. I had to stand and wiggle it around for it to work. After the second movie I just chucked it as it was so unpredictable. Perhaps you may have more luck.At this price I couldn't even be bothered to return it.Still worth another shot but beware of the shoddy the quality.Basically with HDMI if it works it works. If it doesn't you don't get a signal. There is no difference between this and a Monster cable.
4,Eastchester,Excellent Product,great pillow for scoliosis and tmj sufferers. this pillow really gives you comfort support and full night rest without keep tossing and turning. i really love it.
3,Burton,not reliable!,"Broke after 6 months (egg cooker) of very light use (twice or three times a week at most)! Bulky, takes a lot of space on a kitchen counter! It was a bad decision to buy this combo. I wouldn't recommend it!"
4,Burton,Fabulous book!!!!!,"my daughter, who is 6, sometimes has a hard time keeping her attention focused on chapter books. she loved this one so much we plowed through 9 of the 12 chapters in one night and she was begging to finish it the next night. thanks, mr. king-smith!!!!"
5,Bridgewater,the CHOONS!,"Im not sure what is more amazing, the epic awesomeness of the movie? or the epic awesomeness of the amazing music? hmm"
3,Pensacola,Nice cups,"These are decent cups for the money. The insulation keeps drinks cool, and they don't spill when tipped over, although if they are on their side for a long time, sometimes a few drips escape. I will say, there is some dark discoloration on the inner seal inside the spout. I don't feel like it's mildew because we sanitize them in the dishwasher and air dry them properly. I've tried cleaning it out with a toothpick, but the discoloration actually seems to be in the tiny ring of adhesive that seals the rubber valve to the plastic spout. I don't feel like it will get into my kids' drinks. We are pretty happy with these cups."
3,Lancaster,Felt Cheated,"Hello,I bought this product when I was on business visit to US. When i returned India and tried to use it, it never worked. Not once!! I felt cheated and bad. I will never buy any product made by Panasonic again.Arvind"
2,Burton,Doesn't work with Plasma TV's!,"I purchased this headset mainly for watching movies. To my surprise I got terrible static with it and then I saw on page 12 of the manual that plasma displays may interfere with normal operation. I was very disappointed, but Amazon agreed to take this item back for full credit instead of an 80% credit since it was opened."
3,Marysville,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"TRAITOR, HAS BEEN ,LOSER,ALL THE WORDS YOU WANT AREN'T ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS JERK HAS DONE.. HE CAN'T MAKE MONEY ANYWAY OTHER WAY, GOD WHAT A JERKHE WILL SOME HOW PAY FOR THIS WHEN HE DIES WHEN HE WILL BE TOLD HE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO FACE HER AGAIN"
3,Lancaster,Conflicting packaging,"The package touts a ""7-year guarantee"". I bought the batteries mid-May '10. They were made in April '10, and they expire in March 2016. 2016 - 2010 = 6. I have no idea where they got 7."
4,Burton,Works,"i bought this product a few years back. i had a friend's brother put it on. my only complaint was that it was white and not black. i got a percent refunded to me, so i wasn't upset :) i ended up selling the laptop last year and buying an upgrade. the person i sold it to loves it and it still works pretty well for an old laptop."
3,Annapolis,I love it,"i listen to this cd over and over. i love celebrity skin, awful, and hit so hard the best. i know practically all the words!! i love it!"
2,Mansfield,not as good as regular annies,"I am a huge fan of the original annie's pasta meals, so when this came out I thought it was a good idea. However, it was poorly executed. When you use the recomended amount of water, its to water, even after 10 mintues of sitting. Too little, your noodles will clump together and get undercooked. Obviously they didn't test this product enough. Stick to original annie's!"
4,Elmwood Park,Excellent Historical Review!,"Chief Justice Rehnquist is a great historian who focuses his history of the Supreme Court on the cases it has decided.He takes the reader down the path of US history by telling the story fo the Court.He ends the book with a brief few chapters on how the Court operates today, which is extremely insightful.I was taking Con Law I at the time I read this book and it helped put the cases I was reading in a historical perspective.Very good, a must read for the historian/Constitutional Law student!"
5,Holt,Strange Occurance on the DVD,"This has always been one of my all-time favorite movies! I could watch it anytime! Sidney Potier has also been one of my all-time favorite actors!! I think he's brilliant. I think every scene in this movie is great, but my favorite is where Judy Geeson's character dances with Sir. That's a great song in that scene!My copy of this DVD also had the Japanese film on the 2nd side. How disappointing!!! I don't know how most people are about letterbox format, but I like it. I was looking forward to seeing this film in that format, but I couldn't. I returned the disc. I'm really hoping to find a correctly pressed copy of this disc."
4,Wausau,The finer things in life through cat's eyes,"at the risk of sounding like a non-cat lover, i have to confess that i purchased ""my cat saved my life"" because i couldn't imagine how a cat could save anyone's life. after reading it, i now understand what the author, phillip schreibman, was going through and how his cat, alice, taught phillip how to appreciate the finer things in life by example. phillip's life journey has been a difficult one at times & in ""my cat saved my life"", he shares part of that journey and the influence alice had on it. it's a quick read but thought provoking despite it's brevity."
4,Fort Lauderdale,The best yet,"I gave this volume of the Peach Girl series five stars because it is the best of the first three. When the story starts, Sae has finally gotten what she wants; Momo and Toji have broken up. As if this is not enough, she enters Momo in the end of term swim meet... in every event. Not only will Momo be tanner than ever, but she will probably exhaust herself competing. To top it all off, Momo's classmates are crueler than ever. It's Kiley to the rescue, looking out for Momo no matter what... and all he wants in exchange is a ...hug?The first part of this series comes to a grand climax in the last scene of this manga. For all Peach fans rooting for Momo, your heart will break and then you will cheer... buy the book if you want to know what I'm talking about. It will be well worth it."
4,Marysville,leaf blower by toro,not to loud ..blows really nice...weighs a tad..strap would have been nice...very happy with it ..much better than a rake. always had good luck with toro products. a really good buy. consumers report rated it highly.
2,New Windsor,Not worth it,"Pretty cr@ppy product. lasts for a time or two, maybe. doesn't really ""wiggle"" much or shoot too far. not worth the hassle."
1,Wausau,Unbelievable!,"How can you sell a product that has to be constantly manipulated to work?! There should be instructions on how to work a product that should be as easy as plugging it in. I thought the product was damaged during shipment. Glad I read the reviews on how to work it, before going through the trouble of returning it."
2,Kenmore,Very disapointing...,"Not well sealed for all weather purposes. Then I dropped on the front lawn and it broke. This product was a big disappointment. Good for a light to keep under the kitchen sink, that's about it. Next I will check before buying another Chinese flashlight."
4,Lancaster,This show is good for the Soul!!!!!!,"i am so happy to see that others love the show just as much as i do. i am at work right now and went out on amazon to find another movie and was elated to see that the final season of soul food would be out in july. i must admit, i thought the show was five season long, however, as long as i collect all of the seasons i will be happy. i hated when the show ended and still to this day miss the show greatly. this show was my ""woosa"" from hustle of the day. it was my way to escape. to all of the fans of the show enjoy the final season. for those of you who have not had the pleasure of viewing this series.... i promise you won't be disappointed."
2,Sun City Center,Not your Grandpas B&D,"I have a newer model string trimmer - one without the recall. Today was the 3rd time I used it. It broke. The motor runs, but the spool & line does not. I, like others, bought B&D because it WAS a name I respected. After finding the closest repair center is a 100 miles away, I am going to spend half the cost of the trimmer to send it for repairs. (Warranty doesn't cover shipping.) If you go to the B&D website you can see that B&D makes DeWalt and Stanley. If they have gone to making disposable equipment, you may want to avoid their other products."
4,Fort Lauderdale,One of the best books have ever read!!,I have to say that this book one of the most exciting books I have ever read. This book is well written and full of action.
3,Kenmore,This STINKS!!!,"Everytime I use this system I have to use my hand to force the diaper in the pail. Also the seal broke and the smell is aweful!!!!! The seal was broke wihtin the first month and now I am looking to find a new diaper dispisal....this product is no champ, it gets a KO (knock out) not an OK from me!"
4,New Windsor,Good Product,"I think only time will tell if these are the perfect vitamins, but I like their packaging, with three tablets in a small pouch which makes dosing easier. Definitely take them on a full stomach!"
3,Fridley,very good,"I had it for over a year, then I sold it with the camera, I got it for half the price the sony card was.fast, reliable, dependable."
3,Annapolis,Worth it for the remix,"The remix of Hey Jupiter that is featured on this EP is definently worth the price of the CD in and of itself. I think it's an amazing and moving version of the song, and I prefer it over the album version. As for the other tracks, I don't care for the Professional Widow live track, but it's an interesting and sort of creepy experience. ""Sugar"" is a good Tori track, also worth owning - and she talks in the beginning, which I always like. :) I think any Tori fan should definently own this CD, if only for the mix of ""Hey Jupiter""."
5,Holt,A gift for Dad,he loves nora roberts & he is thrilled with his new set. he couldn't wait to get home to listen to them.
4,Fort Lauderdale,A good book overall,"This book is essential to someone who needs pictures (I do not). Should this be the case, and if you plan on rebuilding one of these transmissions, I strongly suggest you use this AND an ATSG manual....and you cannot go wrong. The ATSG manuals is the best, the ONLY, and it's the real bible....but there are no pictures. Once you've done one, you don't need pics, but if you do....the Haynes is the one to buy, and they are cheap! If you have both, you should be OK. I strongly recommend this manual for the price, it would be worth it for twice the money. I have no real use for it, but I wanted to see one for myself and I am quite impressed! If you are not a seasoned transmission guy, buy this, you won't regret it. I am not a fan of the Haynes manuals, but they did a nice job on this particular one and you certainly can't beat the price!"
3,Orland Park,Best of the King Games,"Best of the King games even though that isn't saying very much. This one can be fun, especially multi-player. Great for family entertainment."
2,Mansfield,Wahl Professional 8685 Peanut Classic Clipper/trimmer,"I bought this hair clipper to replace my old one, which just wore out from use. My old ""Peanut"" clipper came with a very nice limber electrical cord and it was easy to use and stored away nicely. The new one came with a very large and very, very stiff cord and is full of kinks which I cannot remove. This makes the clipper awkward to use and impossible to store. I don't recommend buying this clipper, unless you're into frustration!"
3,New Windsor,"the crown and the humility , pulleeeze!","i do love this film, and am sooo happy i got it. a look at the drag pagent scene, and the severity of it all..."
2,Holt,waste of money!!,Mom of 3 kids.I bought this hoping it would be the answer to my daughter's seat belt problem. This would not stay snapped and it was impossible to get the top part to angle correctly away from her face and neck. I returned it the same day.
4,Annapolis,Excellent book for young and old!,"I purchased several of these to teach families about what an effect the mother's mood has on her children. Great book to use in talking about feelings and how to deal with them.Word of caution... my children started ""borking"" me after reading this!"
4,Marysville,Worked like a charm,"As with most Amazon products, shipping was fast.Memory may not be from the Apple store, but works just as well. No, works even better when you consider the price.Great purchase.Do be careful with the installation. You will probably need to buy a teeny weeny screwdriver. Available at Radio Shack."
5,Kenmore,The American Prophecies,"American Prophecies is a GREAT book!!! I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. Mike Evans offered so much insight and understanding into what was behind all the terrorism events that have been going on in Israel and in the United States. Every page was packed full of helpful information, historical information that I was not aware of. Also, the book provided a lot of help in what we can do as Christians, both individually and as a nation, in these last days before the second return of Christ. This book really opened my eyes and explained a lot of things that were going on. I highly recommend the book!"
2,Wausau,Don't waste your money!,I was so disappointed with this book. It was so boring and didn't say anything to add to this very important topic. The chapters just had statisics with just a few references to behavior or solutions. Please don't waste your money on this one. The best one so far was the one written by Robert Hare.
3,Wausau,Flawed Statistics,"I found ""Practical Speculation"" lacking. The first two chapters were interesting, but the analysis of data in subsequent chapters were flawed, in my opinion.Niederhoffer cites scatter plots as demonstrating correlation/predictibility of various aspects of the market. I looked at many graphs and didn't see much that showed statistical correlation. The correlation coefficients (R-squared values) were all very low.The trading ideas were interesting, but the analysis behind them was misleading. You need strategies with better correlations to hurdle transaction costs, and then, maybe, you can make some money."
4,Lancaster,Possibly the best GameCube Game Yet!,"Okay,,Now I have had GameCube for about 2 years now, and when i heard that a new F zero game was comin out,, I was exstatic! I immedaitly bought the game and was this game ever worth it!! The new cources are perfectly detailed, and also longer, giving you the chance for a comeback late in the race! The story mode allows you to see what your characters are eally like. And the graphics?? Could they possible be better, here is my review...Game Play: 9.5/10- Almost perfect, the controls are almost perfect also.Graphics: 10/10- Possible the best graphics I have ever seen.Controls: 10/10- very easy to learnDiffficulty: 9.5/10- Expert is challenging even for masters of the game, making it more fun.Replay Value: 9/10- 25+ cources each about 5 mins long will keep u comin back for more!Overall 10/10- BUY THIS GAME!!"
3,Sayreville,Just Great,"This book is rigorous but understandable, it truly does provide an exhaustive survey of ODE."
3,New Windsor,A good live show.,A good live show by the late Jeff Healey. He sure could sing and play guitar. We will all miss you.
2,Brookfield,Only if you're a professional dancer,"I tried. I really did. But I just could not 'get' the moves in this workout. I'm about as uncoordinated as they come, so I'm sure some of it is me; however, I found that I simply could not contort myself into the positions necessary. Cross this foot over that foot, then kick yourself in the rear. No thanks. I nearly fell over several times just trying."
3,Marysville,Worked four times then broke.,The forth time I went to retract this cord it snapped the inner spring then was useless. The plug itself is terrible. They do not hold the plugs in place. I've plugged in twelve different tools and all fall out when you hold the plug upside down. You basically have to bend the plug so it won't fall out due to gravity. FAIL!!!
1,Mansfield,not thaaaaat good,"it doesn't make much of difference, really. it's a shame we HAVE to buy it for playing Zelda: Majora's Mask. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skating several times, with and without the expansion pack, and i can assure that the difference is almost none. If you're thinking of buying this just for fun (and not for the need of any game) I suggest you to give up. Not worth the money."
5,Orland Park,For Pinky Lovers (and those soon to be) AWESOME!,"For years it has been difficult to find episodes of Pinky and I had about given up on it (I have limited cable access). Volume 1 is GREAT! My boyfriend and I sit and laugh at the incredible, creative, off-the-wall humor. Often we have to replay a sentence or two because one of us missed something too funny to let pass. With the famous ""pinky, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"" lines and their quirky personalities, pinky and brain are sure to delight even new viewers. for more insight into the nuances of the show, it is helpful to read the wikip. piece. i am impatiently awaiting volume 2...."
2,Parma,This vacuum sucks!,I bought two of these - a small one and a large like this one pictured here. Both are a pain in the a**. The one pictured here had to be sent back about five times and now sits in my garage. The second smaller is now starting to have problems with the motor. It is shooting out sparks after having for about 2 1/2 years.The toggle switches get loose and I tired to take the smaller one apart but they make it so you can't do it. So I am waiting till that one burns itself up and it will go to scrap. Very disappointed. I have an old eureka mighty might that still works after falling down the stairs many times and it is over ten years old. I bought those two vacuums because one I thought they would last forever and two because they were made in USA. Thank God for the internet and reviews from everyone because they will help with next purchase.
3,Fridley,Pretty bad mp3 player,"i actually went from a dell jukebox 20gb to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. i loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but i'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time. i had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute! in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but i did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64. brutal. i had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap. never buy this. never."
